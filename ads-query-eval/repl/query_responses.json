      "abstract": "To overcome a bottleneck in spintronic applications such as those of ultralow-power magnetoresistive random-access memory devices, the electric-field control of magnetization vectors in ferromagnetic electrodes has shown much promise. Here, we show the giant converse magnetoelectric (CME) effect in a multiferroic heterostructure consisting of the ferromagnetic Heusler alloy Co<SUB>2</SUB>FeSi and ferroelectric-oxide Pb(Mg<SUB>1/3</SUB>Nb<SUB>2/3</SUB>)O<SUB>3</SUB>-PbTiO<SUB>3</SUB> (PMN-PT) for electric-field control of magnetization vectors. Using an in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of polycrystalline Co<SUB>2</SUB>FeSi film grown on PMN-PT(011), the nonvolatile and repeatable magnetization vector switchings in remanent states are demonstrated. The CME coupling coefficient of the polycrystalline Co<SUB>2</SUB>FeSi/PMN-PT(011) is over 1.0 \u00d7 10<SUP>\u22125 </SUP>s/m at room temperature, comparable to those of single-crystalline Fe<SUB>1-x</SUB>Ga<SUB>x</SUB>/PMN-PT systems. The giant CME effect has been demonstrated by the strain-induced variation in the magnetic anisotropy energy of Co<SUB>2</SUB>FeSi with an L2<SUB>1</SUB>-ordered structure. This approach can lead to a new solution to the reduction in the write power in spintronic memory architectures at room temperature.",

Interplanetary energetic electrons, mainly consisting of continuous solar wind superhalo electrons and transient solar energetic electron events both with typical power-law energy spectra, can provide a source of energetic electrons to the Earth's magnetosphere. After briefly summarizing recent results of solar wind superhalo electrons and solar energetic electron events, this paper reviews the first evidences for the direct and continuous entry of energetic electrons from the interplanetary medium to the Earth's polar cusp, cap and/or lobes, observed by one Chinese BeiDou navigation satellite. Such entering electrons can make a possible contribution to the generation of magnetospheric energetic electrons.",

The propagation characteristics of CMEs in the Corona and interplanetary space determine whether, when and how the CME will hit the Earth. To this end, a lot of progress has been made both on observational and numerical studies of CMEs. With the development of the advanced observational, theoretical and numerical methods, there emerges more and more research on the morphology, the kinematic evolution, the prediction of the arrival at 1 AU and the acceleration/deceleration processes of CMEs. Moreover, many direct observations and simulations have revealed that the CMEs may not propagate along a straight trajectory both in the corona and interplanetary space. Both observational and numerical studies have shown that, when two or more CMEs collide with each other, their kinematic characteristics may change significantly. Here, we present a review of the recent progress associated with the different aspects of CMEs, including their interplanetary counterparts ICMEs, especially focusing on the initiation of the CME, the CMEs' propagation characteristics, interaction with the background solar wind structures, the deflection of the CMEs, the interaction between successive CMEs, the particle acceleration associated with successive CMEs' interaction, and the effect of compound events on Earth's magnetosphere.",

      "abstract": "Indentation tests utilizing the load (P)-displacement (\u03b4) data have been common for obtaining bulk moduli (E) of hydrated materials, including biological specimens and hydrogels. While experimentally simple to perform, the data analysis can sometimes be complicated, especially when adhesion between the indenter and sample occurs. The adhesion issue for nano/microindentation on hydrated materials has been addressed in several studies, but hardly any studies have reported the involvement of adhesion in analyzing mesoscale (0.1-1 mm) P-\u03b4 data. In this study, we evaluated three methods for analyzing experimental P-\u03b4 data acquired from mesoscale indentations on hydrated materials to obtain their E values. They were the classical Hertz model, a modified Hertz approach with P and \u03b4 values corrected using Hertz relations, and a modified Hertz approach with the correction of contact radius (a) by including the work of adhesion, W, between the indenter and the sample. The experimental P, a, and \u03b4 data were simultaneously collected using transparent gelatin gels, and these P-\u03b4 and P-a data were used to verify the adequacy of the three analysis methods. In particular, the E values from these methods were checked against the values obtained using the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts model and the P-a data. Accurate moduli resulted only when W was included in the analysis. The analysis with the inclusion of W was applied to obtain the E values of silicone and other model hydrogels, of which only the experimental P-\u03b4 data could be obtained, and their moduli were found to be close to the values reported.",

The reviewed studies are based on modern observations, historical or long-term data including the auroral and cosmogenic radionuclide record, and Kepler observations of Sun-like stars. We compile a table of 100- and 1000-year events based on occurrence frequency distributions for the space weather phenomena listed above.

      "abstract": "In this review we focus on the fundamental theory of magnetohydrodynamic reconnection, together with applications to understanding a wide range of dynamic processes in the solar corona, such as flares, jets, coronal mass ejections, the solar wind and coronal heating. We summarise only briefly the related topics of collisionless reconnection, non-thermal particle acceleration, and reconnection in systems other than the corona. We introduce several preliminary topics that are necessary before the subtleties of reconnection can be fully described: these include null points (Sects. 2.1-2.2), other topological and geometrical features such as separatrices, separators and quasi-separatrix layers (Sects. 2.3, 2.6), the conservation of magnetic flux and field lines (Sect. 3), and magnetic helicity (Sect. 4.6). Formation of current sheets in two- and three-dimensional fields is reviewed in Sect. 5. These set the scene for a discussion of the definition and properties of reconnection in three dimensions that covers the conditions for reconnection, the failure of the concept of a flux velocity, the nature of diffusion, and the differences between two-dimensional and three-dimensional reconnection (Sect. 4). Classical 2D models are briefly presented, including magnetic annihilation (Sect. 6), slow and fast regimes of steady reconnection (Sect. 7), and non-steady reconnection such as the tearing mode (Sect. 8). Then three routes to fast reconnection in a collisional or collisionless medium are described (Sect. 9). The remainder of the review is dedicated to our current understanding of how magnetic reconnection operates in three dimensions and in complex magnetic fields such as that of the Sun's corona. In Sects. 10-12, 14.1 the different regimes of reconnection that are possible in three dimensions are summarised, including at a null point, separator, quasi-separator or a braid. The role of 3D reconnection in solar flares (Sect. 13) is reviewed, as well as in coronal heating (Sect. 14), and the release of the solar wind (Sect. 15.2). Extensions including the role of reconnection in the magnetosphere (Sect. 15.3), the link between reconnection and turbulence (Sect. 16), and the role of reconnection in particle acceleration (Sect. 17) are briefly mentioned.",

      "abstract": "Observation of auroras at low latitudes is an extremely rare event typically associated with major magnetic storms due to intense Earth-directed Coronal Mass Ejections. Since these energetic events represent one of the most important components of space weather, their study is of paramount importance to understand the Sun-Earth connection. Due to the rarity of these events, being able to access all available information for the few cases studied is equally important. Especially if we refer to historical periods in which current accurate observations from ground-based instruments or space were not available. Certainly, among these events, we must include the great aurora of February 4, 1872. An event whose effects have been observed in different regions of the Earth. What we could consider today a global event, especially for its effects on the communication systems of the time, such as the transatlantic cable that allowed a connection between the United States and Europe since 1866. In this paper, we describe the main results of the observations and studies carried out by Angelo Secchi at the Observatory of the Roman College and described in his Memoria sull'Aurora Elettrica del 4 Febbraio 1872 for the Notes of the Pontifical Academy of new Lincei. This note is extremely modern both in its multi-instrumental approach to the study of these phenomena and in its association between solar-terrestrial connection and technological infrastructures on the Earth. The Secchi's note definitely represents the first example of analysis and study of an event on a global scale, such as the Atlantic cable, affecting the Earth. What we nowadays call an extreme space weather event.",

      "abstract": "The responses of two High-Intensity Long-Duration Continuous AE Activity (HILDCAA) events are investigated using solar wind observations at L1, magnetospheric measurements at geosynchronous orbit, and changes in the global ionosphere. This study provides evidence of the existence of quasi-periodic oscillations (1.5-2 h) in the ionospheric electric field over low latitudes, total electron content at high latitudes, the magnetic field over the globe, energetic electron flux and magnetic field at geosynchronous orbit, geomagnetic indices (SYM-H, AE, and PC) and the Y-component of the interplanetary electric field (IEFy) during the HILDCAA events at all local times. Based on detailed wavelet and cross-spectrum analyses, it is shown that the quasi-periodic oscillation of 1.5-2 h in IEFy is the most effective one that controls the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling process during the HILDCAA events for several days. Therefore, this investigation for the first time, shows that the HILDCAA event affects the global magnetosphere-ionosphere system with a \"quasi-resonant\" mode of oscillation.",

      "abstract": "Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) plans a Phobos sample return mission (MMX: Martian Moons eXploration). In this study, we review the related works on the past climate of Mars, its evolution, and the present climate and weather to describe the scientific goals and strategies of the MMX mission regarding the evolution of the Martian surface environment. The MMX spacecraft will retrieve and return a sample of Phobos regolith back to Earth in 2029. Mars ejecta are expected to be accumulated on the surface of Phobos without being much shocked. Samples from Phobos probably contain all types of Martian rock from sedimentary to igneous covering all geological eras if ejecta from Mars could be accumulated on the Phobos surface. Therefore, the history of the surface environment of Mars can be restored by analyzing the returned samples. Remote sensing of the Martian atmosphere and monitoring ions escaping to space while the spacecraft is orbiting Mars in the equatorial orbit are also planned. The camera with multi-wavelength filters and the infrared spectrometer onboard the spacecraft can monitor rapid transport processes of water vapor, dust, ice clouds, and other species, which could not be traced by the previous satellites on the sun-synchronous polar orbit. Such time-resolved pictures of the atmospheric phenomena should be an important clue to understand both the processes of water exchange between the surface/underground reservoirs and the atmosphere and the drivers of efficient material transport to the upper atmosphere. The mass spectrometer with unprecedented mass resolution can observe ions escaping to space and monitor the atmospheric escape which has made the past Mars to evolve towards the cold and dry surface environment we know today. Together with the above two instruments, it can potentially reveal what kinds of atmospheric events can transport tracers (e.g., H<SUB>2</SUB>O) upward and enhance the atmospheric escape.",

      "abstract": "Since the initial isolation of few-layer graphene, a plethora of two-dimensional atomic crystals has become available, covering almost all known materials types including metals, semiconductors, superconductors, ferro- and antiferromagnets. These advances have augmented the already existing variety of two-dimensional materials that are routinely realized by quantum confinement in bulk-semiconductor heterostructures. This review focuses on the type of material for which two-dimensional realizations are still being actively sought: magnetoelectrics. We present an overview of current theoretical expectation and experimental progress towards fabricating low-dimensional versions of such materials that can be magnetized by electric charges and polarized electrically by an applied magnetic field - unusual electromagnetic properties that could be the basis for various useful applications. The interplay between spatial confinement and magnetoelectricity is illustrated using the paradigmatic example of magnetic-monopole fields generated by electric charges in or near magnetoelectric media. For the purpose of this discussion, the image-charge method familiar from electrostatics is extended to solve the boundary-value problem for a magnetoelectric medium in the finite-width slab geometry using image dyons, i.e., point objects having both electric and magnetic charges. We discuss salient features of the magnetoelectrically induced fields arising in the thin-width limit.",

      "abstract": "Exposure of astronauts to ionising radiation is widely considered to be the biggest threat to sustained Martian habitation. One proposed mitigation is to use Martian regolith (soil) as a shielding material that would not need to be transported from Earth. We consider its effectiveness by estimating the radiation dose from galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles below the Martian surface for mission profiles of 30, 458, and 619 days surface stay. The dose from primary particles is estimated from first principles and compared with the European Space Agency's SPENVIS Mars Energetic Radiation Environment Model. Calculations performed using SPENVIS proved inconclusive and improved confidence in the model output could be achieved with a better understanding of the Martian regolith and its simplified representation within the model. Through first principles estimations we find that Martian regolith would be an effective shield against primary radiation, typically reducing the dose of primary particle radiation by 41% at a depth of 1m, for a 30 day surface stay.",

      "abstract": "Plasma and magnetic field observations by BepiColombo during its 2nd Venus flyby in August 10, 2021 have been examined and compared with the newly developed global hybrid simulation LatHyS for the Venusian environment. The LatHyS-Venus simulation was first validated by a comparison with Venus Express observations obtained during average solar wind conditions, before it was applied to the BepiColombo flyby using as inputs solar wind parameters measured upstream of Venus by Solar Orbiter. The simulation confirms that BepiColombo passed through the stagnation region of Venus, which supports the results obtained by data analysis. In addition, we have sampled the plasma parameters along the BepiColombo trajectory and constructed the energy spectrum for two species, i.e., protons of both solar wind and planetary origins, and planetary oxygen ions, and discussed the possible effects due to the limited field of views of the plasma instruments onboard BepiColombo. The most intense observational features are properly captured in the LatHyS-Venus simulation, which show that the model is a powerful tool for interpreting and understanding in-situ data obtained from the instruments with a limited field of views. The estimated ion escape for protons and oxygen ions at Venus during the BepiColombo flyby is of the order of \u223c10<SUP>24</SUP> ions/s, which is the same order of magnitude compared to the estimation from Venus Express observations at the solar minimum.",

For cycles 21 to 24 (when spacecraft observations have been regularly available), we also investigate the variation in the source location of the solar energetic proton events in relation to four peak flux thresholds in orders of magnitude from \u226510 to \u226510,000 pfu. For helio-latitudes within \u00b140\u00b0 (the range within which active regions usually occur) there is negligible variation in the helio-longitude of the source regardless of the peak flux threshold. However, the effect on the helio-longitude of varying the peak flux threshold is very significant: the higher the threshold the closer is the median source longitude to 0\u00b0, the variation being almost uniform from \u226510 pfu (32\u00b0W) to \u226510,000 pfu (2\u00b0W). Finally, of the 10 events in cycles 19 to 24 with peak flux \u226510,000 pfu, all occurred between years 4 and 8 after solar minimum, all were the result of M- or X-class flares with associated halo CMEs and shock fronts, and the three most intense events (\u226540,000 pfu) were all related to X-class flares which occurred in the longitude range 10-28\u00b0E. These results support and extend previous work by the cited authors, and have implications for solar-terrestrial relations and the effects of space weather within geospace.",

Therefore, this study aims to explain the generation mechanism of this uncommon event, which started at 08:00 UT on February 18, 2015. We used Multiple Global Navigation Satellite Systems (Multi-GNSS, GPS, and GLONASS) data to produce two-dimensional maps of the Rate Of TEC index (ROTI) that show EPB features elongated in magnetic meridians. Also, Digisonde data from S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds (2.53\u00b0 S, 44.30\u00b0 W, dip angle: 8.57\u00b0), Boa Vista (12.81\u00b0 N, 60.67\u00b0 W, dip angle: 33.71\u00b0), and Campo Grande (20.44\u00b0 S, 54.64\u00b0 W, dip angle: 25.98\u00b0), and magnetometer data at S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and Eus\u00e9bio (3.89\u00b0 S, 38.45\u00b0 W, dip angle: 17.96\u00b0). Our analysis shows that the unusual pre-sunrise plasma bubbles lasted longer after sunrise, around 1 h. Finally, we showed that these EPBs are likely driven by a disturbance wind dynamo effect, which helps to understand the role of the external factors in EPBs development.",

      "abstract": "Many systems on our planet shift abruptly and irreversibly from the desired state to an undesired state when forced across a \"tipping point\". Some examples are mass extinctions within ecosystems, cascading failures in infrastructure systems, and changes in human and animal social networks. The ability to avoid such regime shifts or to recover quickly from such a non-resilient state demonstrates a system's resilience; system resilience is a quality that enables a system to adjust its activities to retain its basic functionality when errors and failures occur. In the past 50 years, attention has been paid almost exclusively to low-dimensional systems; scholars have focused on the calibration of the resilience functions of such systems and the identification of indicators of early warning signals based on two to three connected components. In recent years, taking advantage of network theory and the availability of lavish real datasets, network scientists have begun to explore real-world complex networked multidimensional systems, as well as their resilience functions and early warning indicators. This report presents a comprehensive review of resilience functions and regime shifts in complex systems in domains such as ecology, biology, society, and infrastructure. The research approach includes empirical observations, experimental studies, mathematical modeling, and theoretical analysis. We also review the definitions of some ambiguous terms, including robustness, resilience, and stability.",

      "abstract": "Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) contain magnetic field and velocity fluctuations across a wide range of scales. These fluctuations may be interpreted as Alfv\u00e9nic wave packets propagating parallel or antiparallel to the background magnetic field, with the difference in power between counterpropagating fluxes quantified by the cross helicity. We have determined the cross helicity of inertial range fluctuations at 10<SUP>-3</SUP> to 10<SUP>-2</SUP> Hz in 226 ICME flux ropes and 176 ICME sheaths observed by the Wind spacecraft at 1 au during 1995-2015. The flux ropes and sheaths had mean, normalized cross helicities of 0.18 and 0.24, respectively, with positive values here indicating net antisunward fluxes. While still tipped towards the antisunward direction on average, fluxes in ICMEs tend to be more balanced than in the solar wind at 1 au, where the mean cross helicity is larger. Superposed epoch profiles show cross helicity falling sharply in the sheath and reaching a minimum inside the flux rope near the leading edge. More imbalanced, solar wind-like cross helicity was found towards the trailing edge and laterally further from the rope axis. The dependence of cross helicity on flux rope orientation and the presence of an upstream shock are considered. Potential origins of the low cross helicity in ICMEs at 1 au include balanced driving of the closed-loop flux rope at the Sun and ICME-solar wind interactions in interplanetary space. We propose that low cross helicity of fluctuations is added to the standard list of ICME signatures.",

      "abstract": "Advances in high-precision spectrographs have paved the way for the search for an Earth analogue orbiting a Sun-like star within its habitable zone. However, the research community remains limited by the presence of stellar noise produced by stellar magnetic activity. These activity phenomena can obscure the detection of Earth-mass exoplanets and can create parasitic signals in transmission spectra. In this paper, we outline the need for a public forecast of stellar activity and produce a proof of principle. Using publicly available spectra we are able to forecast stellar minima several years ahead and reach a typical uncertainty on the timing of these minima of $\\pm 0.5~\\rm yr$, similar to the precision reached on our own Sun's magnetic cycle. Furthermore, we use our toy model to show that knowing when to observe can improve the sensitivity of HARPS-North's Solar telescope to low-mass planets by up to an order of magnitude, and we show that the majority of exoplanets selected for Early Release Science and Guaranteed Time Observations on the James Webb will be observed close or during stellar maxima, incurring a higher risk of stellar contamination. We finish our paper by outlining a number of next steps to create a public forecast usable by teams around the globe, by telescope time allocation committees, and in preparation for spacecraft such as Ariel.",

The synthesized compounds were studied using DFT/B3LYP level to explore their structural and electronic properties. The frontier molecular orbital, HOMO and LUMO, showed that HOMO was consisted mainly of heteroatoms non-bonding lone pairs of electrons and the \u03c0-orbitals of the phenyl and thiophene rings with minor contribution from the thiazole nucleus of the non-bonding lone pairs. Furthermore, the investigated compounds had low energy gap (\u0394E<SUB>H-L</SUB>), 1.64-2.62 eV, with the derivatives 7 and 4 having lowest and highest gap, respectively. The synthesized compounds exhibited good NLO properties due to their lower charge transfer resistance. The antioxidant activity for the synthesized thiazolyl-thiophene hybrids showed rational antioxidant effectiveness over DPPH technique. The results showed that hybrids 5, 7 and 9 exhibited respectable antioxidant with IC<SUB>50</SUB> values (32.26\u00b10.07, 27.31\u00b10.23 and 23.17\u00b10.36), respectively. However, thiazolyl-thiophene hybrids 4, 6 and 8 were shown tolerable IC<SUB>50</SUB> values (43.28\u00b10.14, 35.36\u00b10.11 and 37.52\u00b10.04), respectively against both of BHT (Butylated hydroxytoluene) and Ascorbic acid as references. The molecular docking estimation was also used on the generated thiazolyl-thiophene hybrids (PDB Code- 3OXI). The hybrids 4, 6 and 8 demonstrated a high binding affinity for the 3OXI amino acids. The docking results were satisfactory, and they mirrored the findings of the antioxidant study.",

Meanwhile, based on the interfacial charge effect and bound magnetopolaron (BMP) theory, magnetic modulation with a magnetoelectric (ME) coupling coefficient up to 133.2 Oe/V is realized at room temperature. More interestingly, by measuring the magnetoresistance, four distinct resistance states are displayed in this multiferroic structure with the ferroelectric reversal.

After briefly summarizing recent results of solar wind superhalo electrons and solar energetic electron events, this paper reviews the first evidences for the direct and continuous entry of energetic electrons from the interplanetary medium to the Earth's polar cusp, cap and/or lobes, observed by one Chinese BeiDou navigation satellite.

      "abstract": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) play an important role in space weather. The propagation characteristics of CMEs in the Corona and interplanetary space determine whether, when and how the CME will hit the Earth. To this end, a lot of progress has been made both on observational and numerical studies of CMEs. With the development of the advanced observational, theoretical and numerical methods, there emerges more and more research on the morphology, the kinematic evolution, the prediction of the arrival at 1 AU and the acceleration/deceleration processes of CMEs. Moreover, many direct observations and simulations have revealed that the CMEs may not propagate along a straight trajectory both in the corona and interplanetary space. Both observational and numerical studies have shown that, when two or more CMEs collide with each other, their kinematic characteristics may change significantly. Here, we present a review of the recent progress associated with the different aspects of CMEs, including their interplanetary counterparts ICMEs, especially focusing on the initiation of the CME, the CMEs' propagation characteristics, interaction with the background solar wind structures, the deflection of the CMEs, the interaction between successive CMEs, the particle acceleration associated with successive CMEs' interaction, and the effect of compound events on Earth's magnetosphere.",

      "abstract": "Quantum flatland i.e., the family of two dimensional (2D) quantum materials has become increscent and has already encompassed elemental atomic sheets (Xenes), 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), 2D metal nitrides/carbides/carbonitrides (MXenes), 2D metal oxides, 2D metal phosphides, 2D metal halides, 2D mixed oxides, etc. and still new members are being explored. Owing to the occurrence of various structural phases of each 2D material and each exhibiting a unique electronic structure; bestows distinct physical and chemical properties. In the early years, world record electronic mobility and fractional quantum Hall effect of graphene attracted attention. Thanks to excellent electronic mobility, and extreme sensitivity of their electronic structures towards the adjacent environment, 2D materials have been employed as various ultrafast precision sensors such as gas/fire/light/strain sensors and in trace-level molecular detectors and disease diagnosis. 2D materials, their doped versions, and their hetero layers and hybrids have been successfully employed in electronic/photonic/optoelectronic/spintronic and straintronic chips. In recent times, quantum behavior such as the existence of a superconducting phase in moir\u00e9 hetero layers, the feasibility of hyperbolic photonic metamaterials, mechanical metamaterials with negative Poisson ratio, and potential usage in second/third harmonic generation and electromagnetic shields, etc. have raised the expectations further. High surface area, excellent young's moduli, and anchoring/coupling capability bolster hopes for their usage as nanofillers in polymers, glass, and soft metals. Even though lab-scale demonstrations have been showcased, large-scale applications such as solar cells, LEDs, flat panel displays, hybrid energy storage, catalysis (including water splitting and CO<SUB>2</SUB> reduction), etc. will catch up. While new members of the flatland family will be invented, new methods of large-scale synthesis of defect-free crystals will be explored and novel applications will emerge, it is expected. Achieving a high level of in-plane doping in 2D materials without adding defects is a challenge to work on. Development of understanding of inter-layer coupling and its effects on electron injection/excited state electron transfer at the 2D-2D interfaces will lead to future generation heterolayer devices and sensors.",

      "abstract": "Metallic zinc (Zn) is one of the most attractive multivalent-metal anode materials in post-lithium batteries because of its high abundance, low cost and high theoretical capacity. However, it usually suffers from large voltage polarization, low Coulombic efficiency and high propensity for dendritic failure during Zn stripping/plating, hindering the practical application in aqueous rechargeable zinc-metal batteries (AR-ZMBs). Here we demonstrate that anionic surfactant-assisted in situ surface alloying of Cu and Zn remarkably improves Zn reversibility of 3D nanoporous Zn electrodes for potential use as high-performance AR-ZMB anode materials. As a result of the zincophilic Zn<SUB>x</SUB>Cu<SUB>y</SUB> alloy shell guiding uniform Zn deposition with a zero nucleation overpotential and facilitating Zn stripping via the Zn<SUB>x</SUB>Cu<SUB>y</SUB>/Zn galvanic couples, the self-supported nanoporous Zn<SUB>x</SUB>Cu<SUB>y</SUB>/Zn electrodes exhibit superior dendrite-free Zn stripping/plating behaviors in ambient aqueous electrolyte, with ultralow polarizations under current densities up to 50 mA cm<SUP>\u22122</SUP>, exceptional stability for 1900 h and high Zn utilization. This enables AR-ZMB full cells constructed with nanoporous Zn<SUB>x</SUB>Cu<SUB>y</SUB>/Zn anode and K<SUB>z</SUB>MnO<SUB>2</SUB> cathode to achieve specific energy of as high as ~ 430 Wh kg<SUP>\u22121</SUP> with ~ 99.8% Coulombic efficiency, and retain ~ 86% after long-term cycles for &gt; 700 h.",

      "abstract": "The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the essential module in energy conversion and storage devices such as electrolyzer, rechargeable metal-air batteries and regenerative fuel cells. The adsorption energy scaling relations between the reaction intermediates, however, impose a large intrinsic overpotential and sluggish reaction kinetics on OER catalysts. Developing advanced electrocatalysts with high activity and stability based on non-noble metal materials is still a grand challenge. Central to the rational design of novel and high-efficiency catalysts is the development and understanding of quantitative structure-activity relationships, which correlate the catalytic activities with structural and electronic descriptors. This paper comprehensively reviews the benchmark descriptors for OER electrolysis, aiming to give an in-depth understanding on the origins of the electrocatalytic activity of the OER and further contribute to building the theory of electrocatalysis. Meanwhile, the cutting-edge research frontiers for proposing new OER paradigms and crucial strategies to circumvent the scaling relationship are also summarized. Challenges, opportunities and perspectives are discussed, intending to shed some light on the rational design concepts and advance the development of more efficient catalysts for enhancing OER performance.",

Our focus is on the largest observed/inferred/theoretical cases of sunspot groups, flares on the Sun and Sun-like stars, coronal mass ejections, solar proton events, and geomagnetic storms. The reviewed studies are based on modern observations, historical or long-term data including the auroral and cosmogenic radionuclide record, and Kepler observations of Sun-like stars. We compile a table of 100- and 1000-year events based on occurrence frequency distributions for the space weather phenomena listed above. Questions considered include the Sun-like nature of superflare stars and the existence of impactful but unpredictable solar \"black swans\" and extreme \"dragon king\" solar phenomena that can involve different physics from that operating in events which are merely large.",

      "abstract": "In this review we focus on the fundamental theory of magnetohydrodynamic reconnection, together with applications to understanding a wide range of dynamic processes in the solar corona, such as flares, jets, coronal mass ejections, the solar wind and coronal heating. We summarise only briefly the related topics of collisionless reconnection, non-thermal particle acceleration, and reconnection in systems other than the corona. We introduce several preliminary topics that are necessary before the subtleties of reconnection can be fully described: these include null points (Sects. 2.1-2.2), other topological and geometrical features such as separatrices, separators and quasi-separatrix layers (Sects. 2.3, 2.6), the conservation of magnetic flux and field lines (Sect. 3), and magnetic helicity (Sect. 4.6). Formation of current sheets in two- and three-dimensional fields is reviewed in Sect. 5. These set the scene for a discussion of the definition and properties of reconnection in three dimensions that covers the conditions for reconnection, the failure of the concept of a flux velocity, the nature of diffusion, and the differences between two-dimensional and three-dimensional reconnection (Sect. 4). Classical 2D models are briefly presented, including magnetic annihilation (Sect. 6), slow and fast regimes of steady reconnection (Sect. 7), and non-steady reconnection such as the tearing mode (Sect. 8). Then three routes to fast reconnection in a collisional or collisionless medium are described (Sect. 9). The remainder of the review is dedicated to our current understanding of how magnetic reconnection operates in three dimensions and in complex magnetic fields such as that of the Sun's corona. In Sects. 10-12, 14.1 the different regimes of reconnection that are possible in three dimensions are summarised, including at a null point, separator, quasi-separator or a braid. The role of 3D reconnection in solar flares (Sect. 13) is reviewed, as well as in coronal heating (Sect. 14), and the release of the solar wind (Sect. 15.2). Extensions including the role of reconnection in the magnetosphere (Sect. 15.3), the link between reconnection and turbulence (Sect. 16), and the role of reconnection in particle acceleration (Sect. 17) are briefly mentioned.",

      "abstract": "Observation of auroras at low latitudes is an extremely rare event typically associated with major magnetic storms due to intense Earth-directed Coronal Mass Ejections. Since these energetic events represent one of the most important components of space weather, their study is of paramount importance to understand the Sun-Earth connection. Due to the rarity of these events, being able to access all available information for the few cases studied is equally important. Especially if we refer to historical periods in which current accurate observations from ground-based instruments or space were not available. Certainly, among these events, we must include the great aurora of February 4, 1872. An event whose effects have been observed in different regions of the Earth. What we could consider today a global event, especially for its effects on the communication systems of the time, such as the transatlantic cable that allowed a connection between the United States and Europe since 1866. In this paper, we describe the main results of the observations and studies carried out by Angelo Secchi at the Observatory of the Roman College and described in his Memoria sull'Aurora Elettrica del 4 Febbraio 1872 for the Notes of the Pontifical Academy of new Lincei. This note is extremely modern both in its multi-instrumental approach to the study of these phenomena and in its association between solar-terrestrial connection and technological infrastructures on the Earth. The Secchi's note definitely represents the first example of analysis and study of an event on a global scale, such as the Atlantic cable, affecting the Earth. What we nowadays call an extreme space weather event.",

      "abstract": "The analysis of samples returned from a planetary body is important to understand the origin, composition, evolution, and interactions with space or atmospheric weathering of the planet. In particular, pristine rocks, which are not affected by weathering, can be collected during sampling work. The analysis of samples will significantly promote the calibration, verification, and interpretation of remote sensing data and will improve the knowledge of interior materials using geophysical measurements. The Chang'e-5 lander, the first Chinese science project involving the return of lunar samples, launched on November 24, 2020 and drilled a core sample that is almost 1 m long, and acquired less than 2 kg during this mission. Because of the preciousness of the returned samples, the CLESEC (China Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center) is planning to construct at least two laboratories, determine regulations for preserving samples from the Moon and other planets in future missions and develop non-damaging and/or minimally damaging technologies to analyze the returned samples. The CLESEC also announced standardized technologies and documentary regulations for preservation, measurement, and sharing schemes with scientists around the world. Based on the Apollo experiences, we have established detailed requirements and standardized conditions for constructing laboratories and curation with the aid of advanced technologies. We also discuss six potential demands for future sampling missions. Finally, we developed high-level criteria for future returning sample missions and relative curations that are beneficial to Chang'e-5 research and as well as preparation for other extraterrestrial samples in the near future.",

This study provides evidence of the existence of quasi-periodic oscillations (1.5-2 h) in the ionospheric electric field over low latitudes, total electron content at high latitudes, the magnetic field over the globe, energetic electron flux and magnetic field at geosynchronous orbit, geomagnetic indices (SYM-H, AE, and PC) and the Y-component of the interplanetary electric field (IEFy) during the HILDCAA events at all local times. Based on detailed wavelet and cross-spectrum analyses, it is shown that the quasi-periodic oscillation of 1.5-2 h in IEFy is the most effective one that controls the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling process during the HILDCAA events for several days. Therefore, this investigation for the first time, shows that the HILDCAA event affects the global magnetosphere-ionosphere system with a \"quasi-resonant\" mode of oscillation.",

      "abstract": "Hayabusa2 returned surface samples from the C-type near-Earth asteroid (162173) Ryugu to Woomera, South Australia, in December 2020. The samples returned from Ryugu are expected to contain not only volatile components reflecting its primitive nature, but also solar wind components due to exposure to space. Such volatiles may partly be released inside the sealed sample container enclosing Ryugu samples due to particle destruction or container heating in a contingency case. In order to collect and analyze volatiles released in the container prior to the container-opening, we set up a gas extraction and analyses system (GAEA: GAs Extraction and Analyses system). The system requires ultra-high vacuum conditions, small vacuum line volume to minimize dead volume and simple configuration as well as having an interface to connect the container. The system includes gas bottles for passive collection of volatiles at room temperature and bottles for active collection at liquid nitrogen temperature. A quadrupole mass spectrometer is installed to analyze gases in the vacuum line, and a non-evaporative getter pump is also used when noble gases are analyzed. The rehearsal operation of the GAEA was made at ISAS/JAXA as well as transportation tests in Japan. In November 2020, it was transported safely to the Quick Look Facility (QLF) in Woomera. It was set up at the QLF and worked as planned for collection and analysis of gas components from the returned sample container. Here we report the concept, design and calibration results for the GAEA and an outline of analytical protocols applied in Woomera.",

      "abstract": "The preliminary impulse of the sudden commencement is simply explained by the generation of the compressional wave due to sudden compression of the dayside magnetopause and mode conversion from the compressional wave to the Alfv\u00e9n wave in the magnetosphere. However, this simple model cannot explain a time delay of the peak displacement and longer duration time in the higher latitudes in the pre-noon and post-noon sectors of the polar region. Based on the global magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system reveals that this peculiar behavior of the geomagnetic variation of the preliminary impulse is associated with temporal deformation of the ionospheric field-aligned current distribution of the preliminary impulse into a crescent shape; its lower-latitude edge extends toward the anti-sunward direction, and its higher-latitude edge almost stays on the same longitude near noon. Numerical simulations revealed that the deformation of the field-aligned current distribution is derived from different behaviors of the two current systems of the preliminary impulse. The first current system consists of the field-aligned current connected to the field-aligned current of the preliminary impulse in the lower latitude side of the ionosphere, the cross-magnetopause current, and the magnetosheath current (type L current system). The cross-magnetopause current is the inertia current generated in the acceleration front of the solar wind due to the sudden compression of the magnetosheath. Thus, the longitudinal speed of the type L current system in the ionosphere is the solar wind speed in the magnetosheath projected into the ionosphere. In contrast, the current system of the preliminary impulse connected to the field-aligned current of the preliminary impulse at higher latitude (type H current system) consists of the upward/downward field-aligned current in the pre-noon/post-noon sector, respectively, and dawn-to-dusk field-perpendicular current along the dayside magnetopause. The dawn-to-dusk field-perpendicular current moves to the higher latitudes in the outer magnetosphere over time. The field-aligned current of the type H current system is converted from the field-perpendicular current due to convergence of the return field-perpendicular current heading toward the sunward direction in the outer magnetosphere; the return field-perpendicular current is the inertia current driven by the magnetospheric plasma flow associated with compression of the magnetopause behind the front region of the accelerated solar wind. The acceleration front spreads concentrically from the subsolar point. Consequently, as the return field-perpendicular current is converted to the field-aligned current of the type H current system, it does not move much in the longitudinal direction over time because the dawn-to-dusk field-perpendicular current of the type H current system moves to the higher latitudes. Therefore, the high-latitude edge of the current distribution of the preliminary impulse in the ionosphere moves only slightly. Finally, we clarified that the conversion between field-perpendicular current and field-aligned current of the type L current system mainly occurs in the region where the Alfv\u00e9n speed starts to increase toward the Earth. A region with a steep gradient of the Alfv\u00e9n speed like the plasmapause is not always necessary for conversion from the field-perpendicular current to the field-aligned current. We also suggest the possible field-aligned structure of the standing Alfv\u00e9n wave that may occur in the preliminary impulse phase.",

      "abstract": "Very low frequency wave intensity variations measured by the Kannuslehto station, Finland in the frequency range 0-12 kHz between 2016 and 2020 are analyzed by the principal component analysis (PCA). As the analyzed ground-based measurements are basically continuous, the length of individual basis vectors entering into PCA is fundamentally arbitrary. To better characterize both long- and short-period variations, two PCAs with different lengths of the basis vectors are eventually performed. Specifically, either daily frequency-time spectrograms or individual frequency spectra are chosen as the PCA basis vectors. Analysis of the first three principal components shows substantial variations of the wave intensity due to seasonal and local time effects. Intensity variations related to the geomagnetic activity characterized by Kp and AE indices and standard deviation of the magnetic field magnitude are less significant. Moreover, PCA allows one to distinguish between nighttime and daytime Kannuslehto variations and study them independently. Solar and geomagnetic activity effects on the daytime and nighttime measurements are discussed. Wave intensity variations related to substorm occurrence are also analyzed.",

      "abstract": "Geomagnetism, similar to other areas of geophysics, is an observation-based science. Data agreement between comparative geomagnetic vector observations is one of the most important evaluation criteria for high-quality geomagnetic data. The main influencing factors affecting the agreement between comparative observational data are the attitude angle, scale factor, long-term time drift, and temperature. In this paper, we propose a method based on a genetic algorithm and linear regression to correct for these effects and use the distribution pattern of points in Bland-Altman plots with a 95% confidence interval length to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the agreement between the comparative observational data. In Bland-Altman plots with better agreement, that is, with the corrected data, more than 95% of the points are distributed within the 95% confidence interval and there is no obvious pattern in the distribution of the points. Meanwhile, the length of 95% confidence interval decreased significantly after the correction. The method presented here has positive effects on the vector instrumentation detection and would enhance the robustness of geomagnetic observatory by bringing the data quality of the backup variometer data in line with the primary variometer.",

      "abstract": "Martian topography modulated non-migrating tides play important roles in the upper atmosphere and thus in the ionosphere through their coupling, especially in their longitude variations. In this study, the neutral scale height (H<SUB>n</SUB>) and ionospheric peak electron density (N<SUB>m</SUB>M<SUB>2</SUB>) and height (h<SUB>m</SUB>M<SUB>2</SUB>) retrieved from the MGS radio occultation measurements were used to investigate the coupling between the Martian thermosphere and ionosphere under the forcing of topography modulated tides by investigating their concurrent longitude variations. A segment of the measurements with fixed local time was selected to analyze the relationships between the longitude variations of the parameters in detail. Longitude variations of the thermosphere and ionosphere are significant though topographic fluctuations are not very prominent at high northern latitudes. Longitude fluctuations of H<SUB>n</SUB> and N<SUB>m</SUB>M<SUB>2</SUB> are nearly in anti-phase and percentage fluctuation amplitudes of H<SUB>n</SUB> are nearly twice as large as those of N<SUB>m</SUB>M<SUB>2</SUB>, which indicate the non-migrating tide forced coupling between the ionosphere and thermosphere conforms to the Chapman theory, and suggests longitude variation of N<SUB>m</SUB>M<SUB>2</SUB> can be used as a quantitative indicator for that of the thermal structure in the lower thermosphere. Longitude variation phases of H<SUB>n</SUB> and h<SUB>m</SUB>M<SUB>2</SUB> are also discrepant. That is due to tide vertical propagation since H<SUB>n</SUB> and h<SUB>m</SUB>M<SUB>2</SUB> depend on the atmospheric thermal structures at different height levels. The thermosphere and ionosphere show longitude variations due to the topography; however, they are dominated by inconsistent longitude components. This implies discrepant exciting and propagating efficiencies of various topography modulated tides.",

The major scientific objectives of this mission are to determine the origin of Phobos and Deimos, to elucidate the early Solar System evolution in terms of volatile delivery across the snow line to the terrestrial planets having habitable surface environments, and to explore the evolutionary processes of both moons and Mars surface environment. To achieve these objectives, during a stay in circum-Martian space over about 3 years MMX will collect samples from Phobos along with close-up observations of this inner moon and carry out multiple flybys of Deimos to make comparative observations of this outer moon. Simultaneously, successive observations of the Martian atmosphere will also be made by utilizing the advantage of quasi-equatorial spacecraft orbits along the moons' orbits.",

      "abstract": "Wave-particle interactions are fundamental processes in space plasma, and some plasma waves, including electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs), are recognised as broadband noises (BBNs) in the electric field spectral data. Spacecraft observations in recent decades have detected BBNs around the Moon, but the generation mechanism of the BBNs is not fully understood. Here, we study a wake boundary traversal with BBNs observed by Kaguya, which includes an ESW event previously reported by Hashimoto et al. Geophys Res Lett 37:L19204 https://doi.org/10.1029/2010GL044529 (2010). Focusing on the relation between BBNs and electron pitch-angle distribution functions, we show that upward electron beams from the nightside lunar surface are effective for the generation of BBNs, in contrast to the original interpretation by Hashimoto et al. Geophys Res Lett 37:L19204 https://doi.org/10.1029/2010GL044529 (2010) that high-energy electrons accelerated by strong ambipolar electric fields excite ESWs in the region far from the Moon. When the BBNs were observed by the Kaguya spacecraft in the wake boundary, the spacecraft's location was magnetically connected to the nightside lunar surface, and bi-streaming electron distributions of downward-going solar wind strahl component and upward-going field-aligned beams (at \u223c124 eV) were detected. The interplanetary magnetic field was dominated by a positive B<SUB>Z</SUB> (i.e. the northward component), and strahl electrons travelled in the antiparallel direction to the interplanetary magnetic field (i.e. southward), which enabled the strahl electrons to precipitate onto the nightside lunar surface directly. The incident solar wind electrons cause negative charging of the nightside lunar surface, which generates downward electric fields that accelerate electrons from the nightside surface toward higher altitudes along the magnetic field. The bidirectional electron distribution is not a sufficient condition for the BBN generation, and the distribution of upward electron beams seems to be correlated with the BBNs. Ambipolar electric fields in the wake boundary should also contribute to the electron acceleration toward higher altitudes and further intrusion of the solar wind ions into the deeper wake. We suggest that solar wind ion intrusion into the wake boundary is also an important factor that controls the BBN generation by facilitating the influx of solar wind electrons there.",

      "abstract": "A spectrogram of Power Line Harmonic Radiation (PLHR) consists of a set of lines with frequency spacing corresponding exactly to 50 or 60 Hz. It is distinct from a spectrogram of Magnetospheric Line Radiation (MLR) where the lines are not equidistant and drift in frequency. PLHR and MLR propagate in the ionosphere and the magnetosphere and are recorded by ground experiments and satellites. If the source of PLHR is evident, the origin of the MLR is still under debate and the purpose of this paper is to understand how MLR lines are formed. The ELF waves triggered by High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) in the ionosphere are used to simulate lines (pulses of different lengths and different frequencies). Several receivers are utilized to survey the propagation of these pulses. The resulting waves are simultaneously recorded by ground-based experiments close to HAARP in Alaska, and by the low-altitude satellite DEMETER either above HAARP or its magnetically conjugate point. Six cases are presented which show that 2-hop echoes (pulses going back and forth in the magnetosphere) are very often observed. The pulses emitted by HAARP return in the Northern hemisphere with a time delay. A detailed spectral analysis shows that sidebands can be triggered and create elements with superposed frequency lines which drift in frequency during the propagation. These elements acting like quasi-periodic emissions are subjected to equatorial amplification and can trigger hooks and falling tones. At the end all these known physical processes lead to the formation of the observed MLR by HAARP pulses. It is shown that there is a tendency for the MLR frequencies of occurrence to be around 2 kHz although the exciting waves have been emitted at lower and higher frequencies.",

      "abstract": "Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) plans a Phobos sample return mission (MMX: Martian Moons eXploration). In this study, we review the related works on the past climate of Mars, its evolution, and the present climate and weather to describe the scientific goals and strategies of the MMX mission regarding the evolution of the Martian surface environment. The MMX spacecraft will retrieve and return a sample of Phobos regolith back to Earth in 2029. Mars ejecta are expected to be accumulated on the surface of Phobos without being much shocked. Samples from Phobos probably contain all types of Martian rock from sedimentary to igneous covering all geological eras if ejecta from Mars could be accumulated on the Phobos surface. Therefore, the history of the surface environment of Mars can be restored by analyzing the returned samples. Remote sensing of the Martian atmosphere and monitoring ions escaping to space while the spacecraft is orbiting Mars in the equatorial orbit are also planned. The camera with multi-wavelength filters and the infrared spectrometer onboard the spacecraft can monitor rapid transport processes of water vapor, dust, ice clouds, and other species, which could not be traced by the previous satellites on the sun-synchronous polar orbit. Such time-resolved pictures of the atmospheric phenomena should be an important clue to understand both the processes of water exchange between the surface/underground reservoirs and the atmosphere and the drivers of efficient material transport to the upper atmosphere. The mass spectrometer with unprecedented mass resolution can observe ions escaping to space and monitor the atmospheric escape which has made the past Mars to evolve towards the cold and dry surface environment we know today. Together with the above two instruments, it can potentially reveal what kinds of atmospheric events can transport tracers (e.g., H<SUB>2</SUB>O) upward and enhance the atmospheric escape.",

      "abstract": "Hydrogen production through electrolysis from renewable sources is expected to play an important role to achieve the reduction targets of carbon dioxide emissions set for the next decades. Electrolysers can use the renewable energy surplus to produce green hydrogen and contribute to making the electrical grid more stable. Hydrogen can be used as medium-long term energy storage, converted into other fuels, or used as feedstock in industry thus contributing to decarbonise hard-to-abate-sectors. However, due to the intermittent and variable nature of solar and wind power, the direct coupling of electrolysers with renewables may lead to high production fluctuations and frequent shutdowns. As a consequence, accelerated electrolyser degradation and safety issues related to low load operation may arise. In this study, simulations of hydrogen production with an electrolyser fed by a PV system are performed in Matlab for a reference year. The effect of PV power fluctuations on the electrolyser operation and production is investigated. The impact of the electrolyser size for a fixed nominal power of the PV plant is also analysed from both energetic and economic points of view.",

      "abstract": "Neutral exospheres of large airless bodies consist of atoms or molecules on ballistic trajectories. An import example is the lunar water exosphere, thought to transport water to cold traps. In anticipation of future observational measurements, the theory of thermalized surface-bounded gravitationally-bound exospheres is further developed. The vertical density profile is calculated using thermodynamic averages of an ensemble of ballistic trajectories. When the launch velocities follow the Maxwell-Boltzmann Flux distribution, the classical density profile results. For many other probability distributions, including thermal desorption from a vertical wall, the density diverges logarithmically near the surface. Hence, an exosphere resulting from thermal desorption from a rough surface includes a ground-hugging population that appears to be colder than the surface. Another insight derived from the thermodynamic perspective is that cold traps can be interpreted in terms of the frostpoint of the water exosphere, if the long-term average of the pressure of the exosphere is considered. Ice in lunar caves is long-lasting only if the cave interior is below the cold trap temperature threshold.",

      "abstract": "Analysis of the variation of the potential gradient (PG) at ground level is important to monitor the global electric circuit and the different solar and geophysical phenomena affecting it. However, this is challenging since several local factors (e.g., meteorological) produce perturbations in the potential gradient. Time series and spectral analysis of PG at several stations can help to minimise local effects so that global effects may be more clearly observed. In this work, for the first time we performed spectral analysis of the potential gradient recorded at several sites located at Vostok, Concordia, Halley and Casleo (Southern Hemisphere), and Sodankyla and Reading (Northern Hemisphere). In order to find the main periodicities and how the amplitude of those periods change as a function of time we use the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and the wavelet transform, respectively. For all PG sites we found periodicities of 0.5-, 1-, ~180- and 365-day. Our results show that the 0.5-day (1-day) periodicity is more prominent during the months of June-July-August (December-January-February). Evidence of ~27- and ~ 45-day periods was also observed at multiple sites. Further analysis using the cross-wavelet transform for PG versus cosmic rays, PG versus Madden-Julian Oscillation index, and PG versus meteorological parameters, show clues that the 27- and 45-day periods are likely related to the solar rotation and Madden-Julian Oscillation, respectively. Furthermore, our results show that during the passages of co-rotating interaction regions, the 27-day period for PG vs cosmic rays XWT is stronger than for the other XWT analysis.",

The experimental results indicate that the ZIS@NCS composites possess large specific surface area and abundant photocatalytic active center due to the intimate interface contact between ZIS nanosheets and NCS hollow backbones, which are favorable for visible light absorption and the interfacial carrier transfer in photocatalytic reaction process. Density functional theory further proved the above insights. The dynamics of photo-induced electrons were extensively characterized. As a result, the optimal sample of ZIS@NCS-7 exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 1950 \u03bcmol h<SUP>-1</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP>, which was 6.1 times that of pristine ZIS and much higher than the other photocatalysts under otherwise identical conditions. The apparent quantum efficiency of ZIS@NCS-7 composites reached 9.3% at 420 nm. This work provides a novel standpoint for the design and construction of more efficient photocatalyst with robust light absorption.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a new numerical model developed to assist with Data Interpretation and Numerical Analysis of ionospheric Missions and Observations (DINAMO). DINAMO derives the ionospheric electrostatic potential at low- and mid-latitudes from a two-dimensional dynamo equation and user-specified inputs for the state of the ionosphere and thermosphere (I-T) system. The potential is used to specify the electric fields and associated F-region E \u00d7 B plasma drifts. Most of the model was written in Python to facilitate the setup of numerical experiments and to engage students in numerical modeling applied to space sciences. Here, we illustrate applications and results of DINAMO in two different analyses. First, DINAMO is used to assess the ability of widely used I-T climatological models (IRI-2016, NRLMSISE-00, and HWM14), when used as drivers, to produce a realistic representation of the low-latitude electrodynamics. In order to evaluate the results, model E \u00d7 B drifts are compared with observed climatology of the drifts derived from long-term observations made by the Jicamarca incoherent scatter radar. We found that the climatological I-T models are able to drive many of the features of the plasma drifts including the diurnal, seasonal, altitudinal and solar cycle variability. We also identified discrepancies between modeled and observed drifts under certain conditions. This is, in particular, the case of vertical equatorial plasma drifts during low solar flux conditions, which were attributed to a poor specification of the E-region neutral wind dynamo. DINAMO is then used to quantify the impact of meridional currents on the morphology of F-region zonal plasma drifts. Analytic representations of the equatorial drifts are commonly used to interpret observations. These representations, however, commonly ignore contributions from meridional currents. Using DINAMO we show that that these currents can modify zonal plasma drifts by up to ~ 16 m/s in the bottom-side post-sunset F-region, and up to ~ 10 m/s between 0700 and 1000 LT for altitudes above 500 km. Finally, DINAMO results show the relationship between the pre-reversal enhancement (PRE) of the vertical drifts and the vertical shear in the zonal plasma drifts with implications for equatorial spread F.",

      "abstract": "In mid- and low-latitude ionospheric F-region on the dayside, magnetic field and electron density (Ne) fluctuations with amplitude smaller than a few nT and 1-2% of Ne, respectively, are commonly observed. Their spatial scale along satellite orbit is around 70-250 km. It is presumed that they are generated by the waves propagated from lower atmosphere. However, the mode of waves (acoustic wave or internal gravity wave) and their source are not yet clear. Among the possible sources, cumulus convection and/or associated rainfall are considered to be the strong candidates for the atmospheric wave generation. We use the rainfall estimated by the hourly Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (JAXA/GSMaP) as a proxy of lower atmospheric disturbance as the wave source, and compare the rainfall with the amplitude of magnetic fluctuations (magnetic ripples) and electron density fluctuations observed by the Swarm satellites. The data from April 2014 to July 2020 are used. The global distribution of rainfall estimated by the GSMaP and its seasonal variation have similarities with amplitude distribution of magnetic ripples and electron density fluctuations on the dayside. We calculate the ratio of their magnitude, i.e., amplitude of magnetic ripples or electron density fluctuations in rainfall cases to those in no-rainfall cases. Although the longitudinally averaged ratio is not very large but around 1.1-1.2 in \u00b1 10- \u00b1 50\u00b0 Apex latitudes, it is clearly larger than 1.0. The ratio increases when the intensity of rainfall (mm/h) increases. These results indicate that a cumulous convection which causes rainfall is one of the main sources of atmospheric waves that produce magnetic ripples and electron density fluctuations commonly observed in the dayside ionosphere. Anticipating acoustic waves as the driver of magnetic ripples and electron density variations, a difference in the generation mechanism of electron density fluctuations from that of magnetic ripples is suggested even if their sources are common.",

This study focuses on the latitudinal and interhemispheric differences of the enhanced semi-diurnal lunitidal (M2) perturbations related to SSW using total electron content calculated from the network of Global Navigation Satellite System and ionosonde data in the eastern Asia-Australia sector during the January 2009 SSW. Our results show that the most distinct M2 perturbations in the northern and southern hemispheres occur near the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly crest regions around \u00b1 15\u00b0 geomagnetic latitudes, but corresponds to different moon phases, respectively. Clear M2 perturbations extend to middle latitudes only in the southern hemisphere and have another local maximum in the southern middle latitude. Such latitudinal and interhemispheric features of ionospheric M2 perturbations in the low latitude in the eastern Asia-Australia sector are similar as those in the American sector during the same SSW event. This supports previous suggestion that such latitudinal and interhemispheric differences in the low latitude can be primarily explained by the summer-winter thermospheric wind modulation on equatorial plasma fountain and thus emphasize its role in the vertical coupling process of M2 perturbation. The clear differences of M2 perturbations in the southern middle latitude between the eastern Asia-Australia and American sectors indicate that the thermospheric circulation related to the Weddell Sea Anomaly may have influence on the lower atmosphere-ionosphere coupling.",

      "abstract": "The daily values of the E<SUB>KL</SUB> field and indices of magnetic activity PC, AL and Dst were used to verify stability of relationships between these parameters in course of 23rd and 24th solar cycles. The results of analysis demonstrate that the mean level of correlation between the E<SUB>KL</SUB> field and PC index remains in range R = 0.85-0.90 over 24 years. During the solar maximum epochs (2008, 2015) the correlation between E<SUB>KL</SUB> and PC reduced down to R = 0.75, the decrease being related to solar protons events (SPE), which strongly affect the ionospheric conductivity in polar caps. In the course of both cycles the daily AL index well correlated with PC index (R = 0.93) and with E<SUB>KL</SUB> field (R = 0.83); correlation of daily Dst index with PC and EKL values was much worse (R = 0.72 and 0.64, correspondingly), the correlation being independent of solar activity epochs and cycles. The PC indices in northern (PCN) and southern (PCS) indices hemispheres demonstrate the evident seasonal variation; the PCsummer index is commonly larger than the PCwinter index, but PCwinter index better correlates with E<SUB>KL</SUB> field. The conclusion is made that relationships between the E<SUB>KL</SUB> field, PC index, and the magnetic disturbance indices AL and Dst remained valid in course of 23rd and 24th solar cycles and, therefore, the calibrating coefficients, determining these relationships, are not affected by solar activity.",

This paper presents a systematic numerical study of the magnetospheric and ionospheric influences on the evolution and modification of FACs, with focus on the role of ionospheric Pedersen conductance and its gradient. FACs are typically generated in the magnetosphere and are carried into the ionosphere by Alfv\u00e9n waves. During their reflection from the ionosphere, these FACs are modified. The nature of modifications depends on the magnitude and distribution of ionospheric Pedersen conductance. A uniform ionosphere, having a high Pedersen conductance, enhances such a magnetospheric FAC strongly. For conductance-gradients perpendicular to the wave-polarization, FACs are generated after the reflection of simple Alfv\u00e9nic perturbations, which are not carrying any FACs. A suitable arrangement of ionospheric Pedersen conductance can create a pair of antiparallel FACs, with consequent generation of a strong Pedersen current at the ionospheric boundary. For conductance-gradients along the polarization of the wave, the steady state velocity perturbation assumes an average value of the imposed Pedersen conductance over the entire region after reflection from the ionosphere. This configuration is comparable to the situation where the Cowling conductance operates.",

The observations are conducted over a fixed longitude (\u223c117\u00b0W geographic) during May 27-31, 2017 (duration with intense geomagnetic storm without any significant solar flare event), September 3-6, 2017 (duration with solar flare events), September 7-16, 2017 (duration with intense to moderate solar flares as well as geomagnetic storms) and November 28-30, 2020 (duration with a moderate solar flare event with no geomagnetic storm in association). It is found that the effects were the highest during May 27-31, 2017 among all of these events. From the observations of super-imposed effects of the geophysical events, it was found that the effects of an X-class solar flare on September 10-12, 2017 on mid-latitude ionization were suppressed by the Disturbed Dynamo Electric Field (DDEF) from high latitudes during the recovery phase of an intense CME driven geomagnetic storm. The weak effects were also explained by the position of origination of the flare at the Sun. Correlations were observed between the variations in O/N<SUB>2</SUB>, neutral wind velocities and the mid and high latitude Total Electron Content (TEC) during these periods. Possible explanation is given for those few cases (for example, September 14, 2017) when the variations in O/N<SUB>2</SUB> mismatched with the local TEC especially in the mid-latitudes. The effects of the solar flare event on November 28-30, 2020 which were short-lived have also been also observed at locations near the subsolar point from low latitudes in the southern hemisphere.",

While the onset time in the southern hemisphere is identified by eye, the value of the differences in the onset time between the northern and southern hemispheres is determined using cross covariance. We observe differences in the onset time between the two hemispheres as large as several minutes, but 53% of the events show no difference in the onset time. Using statistics, we show that the largest differences in onset time are associated with the summer and winter seasons and when the IMF By value is limited between 0.5 and 2.5 nT, which is the IMF By range when the local time difference between the northern and southern hemisphere foot points is the smallest. The results indicate that ionospheric conductivity associated with solar illumination plays a role in the differences in onset time between the northern and southern hemisphere when only non-zero differences in onset time are considered. We validate these results with two other less robust methods. The median value of the differences in onset time indicates that the onsets occur \u223c23 s earlier in the winter hemisphere than that in the summer hemisphere. It has been reported that the time difference between the start of the substorm in the magnetotail and the observed auroral break up (substorm auroral onset) in the ionosphere is 30 s to 2 min in the current disruption model and the near earth neutral line model, respectively. Our results may be of interest to those two models.",

      "abstract": "This paper studies the influence of the electromagnetic field of outer space on spacecraft. Analytical dependences are obtained for the energy emitted by a satellite taking into account the direction of propagation of Alfv\u00e9n waves. It is postulated that the linear term in the energy equation affects the induction for an arbitrary law of current distribution in a satellite in an electromagnetic field. It is proved that, when a satellite moves at medium altitudes, the current distribution in the magnetospheric plasma can be satisfactorily approximated by segments of straight lines with a maximum at the point of zero potential, while the induced components of the magnetic field can be determined by integration. The induced component of the magnetic field is determined. It is noted that, in the absence of energy dissipation, the total radiation energy is expressed as the product of the satellite speed and inductive resistance.",

      "abstract": "Lightning occurrence at higher latitudes in northwestern Europe is by far less frequent than mainland continental and the Mediterranean during most of the year. Yet, as recent studies suggest, this region harbors a large fraction of the most energetic lightning flashes on Earth, commonly referred to as superbolts. In this study, we examine the time/locations of intense cloud-to-ground (CG) strokes (&gt;200 kA in absolute value), provided by M\u00e9t\u00e9orage for the 10.5-year period (from Jan 2010 to Jul 2020), to present a high-resolution map of their distribution, pointing out relevant discrepancies observed between -CG and + CG, respectively. We additionally investigate the potential of superbolts to result in short-lived optical phenomena above thunderstorms, collectively known as transient luminous events (TLEs). Observations in the region indicate that isolated superbolts with substantial charge moment change can produce sprites during low active marginal winter thunderstorms, in the absence of concurrent IC/CG activity several minutes before and after the event. An example is described when 3 sprites were captured in a similar context during the night of 7th/8th February 2016. We suggest that: i) convergence and aerosols advection from sea surface and busy shipping lanes may favour deep convection and cloud electrification on the English Channel with respect to surrounding areas. Inherent differences in cloud charge structure of sea based storms could lead to faster negative leader vertical velocity than those for storms over land, on average, and hence in larger peak currents, determining the winter peak of negative superbolts in the area; ii) areas occupied by the most populated superbolt clusters can be used to conduct future research in the region, aimed at better characterising microphysical properties of superbolts and their potential in generating TLEs.",

      "abstract": "We present results from a suite of models designed to simulate solar flare effects on the D and E region of the ionosphere. This suite includes models of the solar spectrum, the ionosphere and of HF radiowave propagation. A central component of this system is the development of photoelectron ionization enhancement factors with higher energy resolution in the soft X-ray spectral region that can be used to supplement existing ionization schemes currently implemented in upper atmospheric general circulation models. We tested this photoelectron model in the NCAR Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere- Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIME-GCM) and in a photochemical model of the D region. In both cases, we compared predicted flare response using two different input solar flare spectra. One is the Flare Irradiance Spectral Model (FISM) and the other is a physics based model called NRLFLARE. Our predictions for the E region were compared with incoherent scatter radar data and suggest that enhanced flux in the 1-2 nm spectral region, as indicated by NRLFLARE, is important for reproducing the observations. For the D region, we combined our theoretical results for the X1.3 flare of 7 September 2017 with ray tracing calculations that suggest 20-40 db of 6.4 MHz absorption. This agrees with previously published observations and model estimates, all of which suggest greater HF absorption than the operational D region absorption prediction model (swpc.noaa.gov/products/d-region-absorption-predictions-d-rap). Finally, our theoretical comparison with previously published empirical models derived from very low frequency data was less clear due, in part, to large differences between the different empirical models.",

      "abstract": "The amplitudes of lightning sferics are commonly used for data analyses, for example, in lightning location networks. This contribution investigates the coherency of lightning sferics, which is calculated from the phase of the analytic complex signal. The complex signal is obtained from the Hilbert transform with the recorded signal as the input signal. This analytic signal is composed of amplitudes with corresponding phases. Rigorous selection criteria are applied to ensure that consistent events are used to calculate distance-dependent average sferics waveforms which are summarized in waveform banks for the amplitude and coherency. The impulse response to lightning flashes is derived from an averaged waveform which is used to detect individual lightning events. It is shown that the coherency waveform bank is in general agreement with the amplitude waveform bank, that is, the relative arrival times of the ground and sky waves. The coherency waveform bank exhibits the same number of skywaves on the logarithmic scale, but a less attenuated ground wave when compared to the amplitude waveform bank. The results of this study show that the phase of sferics offers additional information to amplitudes, which could potentially be used for the interferometric lightning location with long-range lightning detection networks.",

To support this effort, ground networks of magnetometer stations, optical instruments, and radars have been deployed. However, the spatial coverage of such networks is naturally restricted by the distribution of land mass and access to necessary infrastructure. We present a new technique for local mapping of polar ionospheric electrodynamics, for use in regions with high data density, such as Fennoscandia and North America. The technique is based on spherical elementary current systems (SECS), which were originally developed to map ionospheric currents. We expand their use by linking magnetic field perturbations in space and on ground, convection measurements from space and ground, and conductance measurements, via the ionospheric Ohm's law. The result is a technique that is similar to the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) technique, but tailored for regional analyses of arbitrary spatial extent and resolution. We demonstrate our technique on synthetic data, and with real data from three different regions. We also discuss limitations of the technique and potential areas for improvement.",

      "abstract": "We utilize Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements and electron density (Ne) retrieval profiles from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers onboard multiple Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites to characterize large-scale ionosphere-thermosphere system responses during geomagnetic storms. We also analyze TEC measurements from GNSS receivers in a worldwide ground-based network. Measurements from four storms during June and July 2012 (boreal summer months), December 2015 (austral summer month), and March 2015 (equinoctial month) are analyzed to study global ionospheric responses and the interhemispheric asymmetry of these responses. We find that the space-based and ground-based TECs and their responses are consistent in all four geomagnetic storms. The global 3D view from GNSS-Radio Occultation (RO) Ne observations captures enhancements and the uplifting of Ne structures at high latitudes during the initial and main phases. Subsequently, Ne depletion occurs at high latitudes and starts progressing into midlatitude and low latitude as the storm reaches its recovery phase. A clear time lag is evident in the storm-induced Ne perturbations at high latitudes between the summer and winter hemispheres. The interhemispheric asymmetry in TEC and Ne appears to be consistent with the magnitudes of the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) high latitude integrated field-aligned currents (FACs), which are 3-4 MA higher in the summer hemisphere than in the winter hemisphere during these storms. The ionospheric TEC and Ne responses combined with the AMPERE-observed FACs indicate that summer preconditioning in the ionosphere-thermosphere system plays a key role in the interhemispheric asymmetric storm responses.",

      "abstract": "Based on 10 years' of vertical total electron content (VTEC) data in solar cycle 24 from Ahmedabad (23.0\u00b0N, 72.6\u00b0E, dip angle 35.2\u00b0), a station under the crest region of equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA), it is shown that both the integrated residual and total post-sunset enhancements in VTEC are conspicuous during Equinox and December solstice when solar flux level exceeds 110 solar flux unit (sfu) with the exception of the year 2012-2013. The post-sunset enhancements are absent in June solstice at this local time even if the solar flux level exceeds 110 sfu. The integrated residual and total VTEC enhancements during post-sunset hours are found to be linearly correlated with the solar flux level in Equinox and December solstice. It is noted that a parabolic fit works better for the integrated total VTEC enhancement during December solstice suggesting a possible saturation of VTEC enhancements at high solar flux levels. Based on these observations and Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics-General circulation model (TIE-GCM) outputs, it is argued that the pre-reversal enhancement (PRE) in the equatorial F region zonal electric field works in tandem with latitudinal gradient in the F region plasma density to determine the degree of VTEC enhancement over the EIA crest region during post-sunset hours. These results highlight the solar flux dependence of the post-sunset enhancement of VTEC over the crest region and show that sudden stratospheric warming events in 2012-2013 suppressed these enhancements in December solstice even if solar flux levels exceeded 110 sfu.",

Previous theory in the literature is advanced by the effects of the terrestrial inhomogeneous magnetic field embedded in weakly ionized ionospheric layers ranging in altitude from about 50 to 500 km. It is shown that the ionospheric conducting fluids can support the formation of solitary dipolar vortices (or modons). Both analytical and numerical solutions of the latter are obtained and analyzed. It is found that in absence of the Pedersen conductivity, different vortex structures with different space localization can be formed which can move with the supersonic velocity without any energy loss. However, its presence can cause the amplitude of the solitary vortices to decay with time and the vortex structure can completely disappear owing to the energy loss. Such energy loss can be delayed, i.e., the vortex structure can prevail for relatively a longer time if the nonlinear effects associated with either the stream function or the density variation become significantly higher than the dissipation due to the Pedersen conductivity. The main characteristic dynamic parameters are also defined which are in good correlation with the existing experimental data.",

In order to consolidate PCS indices based on Vostok data or replace poor or missing index data, derivation procedures have been developed to generate alternative PCS index values based on data from Dome Concordia (Dome-C) magnetic observations from epoch 2009-2020 of solar cycle 24. The reference levels and calibration parameters needed for calculations of Dome-C-based PCS values in post-event and real-time versions are defined and explained in the present work. Assessments of the new PCS index have shown its unprecedented high relevance. Part of the methods used here, such as the quiet reference level construction and the correlation and regression procedures used for calculations of scaling parameters, deviate from corresponding features considered inadequate of the International Association for Geomagnetism and Aeronomy-endorsed PC index derivation methods.",

The multifrequency multiple path system located at the Harbin Engineering University campus, the PRC, and probing the ionosphere at oblique incidence was used to identify the effects from the typhoons. The response of the ionosphere to the Typhoon Lingling was detected along three adjacent radio-wave propagation paths where chaotic and quasiperiodic variations in the Doppler shift and a significant (from \u22121 to 1 Hz or greater) Doppler spectrum broadening were observed to occur. The Doppler spectrum chaotic variations are due to plasma turbulence generated by typhoons in the ionosphere, and the Doppler shift quasiperiodic variations along the main ray are due to infrasound and atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) launched by the typhoons. The relative amplitude of quasiperiodic variations in the electron density in the field of the infrasound wave reached several percent, and in the field of the AGW attained from ten to a few tens of percent. The effects of the Typhoon Faxai during 9/10 and 10/11 September 2019 nights were accompanied by a 27% decrease in the electron density in the ionospheric E and F regions. At the closest approach of the Typhoon Faxai to the ionosonde during 8/9 September 2019 night, when it had the largest energy, a 56% increase was detected in the ionospheric F region electron density.",

However, it is not clear how these factors influence the cusp aurora in the Southern Hemisphere. Using DMSP/SUSSI observations from 2004 to 2017 during non-storm periods, we compared the factors affecting the intensity of cusp aurora between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres by dividing the observations into weak- and intense-emission events. We found that the auroral intensity in the southern cusp: (a) has a positive correlation with solar wind power input, (b) is statistically weak under southward IMF conditions, and (c) is critically controlled by the IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> and V<SUB>sw</SUB>. These results are essentially consistent with those obtained in the Northern Hemisphere. However, the IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> effect shows apparent interhemispheric asymmetry, that is, the IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> effect reaches the maximum at 2 nT in the Northern Hemisphere, but at \u22122 nT in the Southern Hemisphere. Further analysis shows that the 2-nT deviations disappear after dividing all events by season and the IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> distributions of intense-emission events show clear seasonal difference. Based on these results, we suggest that the dependence of the cusp auroral intensity on the IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> is not only controlled by \u2212V<SUB>sw</SUB> \u00d7 B<SUB>y</SUB> field, but also affected by season.",

      "abstract": "We analyze 3 years of 1 eV-40 keV H<SUP>+</SUP> pitch angle distributions (PADs) near the magnetic equatorial plane, observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) Hot Plasma Composition Analyzer (HPCA). Our analysis includes an energy correction to shift ion energy upward by an amount equal to the spacecraft potential. We find asymmetric distributions for cold (&lt;10 eV) and warm (10-100 eV) H<SUP>+</SUP> ions coming preferentially from the northern hemisphere (NH) over those from the southern hemisphere (SH). Specifically, the average phase space density (PSD) in the antiparallel direction (pitch angle above 135\u00b0) is about 1.7 times higher than in the parallel direction (below 45\u00b0) for H<SUP>+</SUP> with energy &lt;100 eV on the dawn side (MLT: 3-9 hr) for all L shells. To understand the cause of this NH-SH asymmetry, we sort the distributions by Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) direction and dipole tilt angle. Sorting by IMF direction shows that PSDs in the antiparallel direction are higher than in the parallel direction when IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> is dawnward (B<SUB>y</SUB> &lt; 0). The outflow of cold H<SUP>+</SUP> from the NH is higher when the dipole tilt angle is positive (\u03bc &gt; 10\u00b0). In contrast, when the dipole tilt is negative (\u03bc &lt; \u221210\u00b0), the outflow of cold H<SUP>+</SUP> from the SH is not significantly higher and PADs can have either symmetric or asymmetric favoring from NH. These results suggest there may be general interhemispheric asymmetry of ion outflow that favors the NH.",

      "abstract": "Magnetic investigations of icy moons have provided some of the most compelling evidence available confirming the presence of subsurface, liquid water oceans. In the exploration of ocean moons, especially Europa, there is a need for mathematical models capable of predicting the magnetic fields induced under a variety of conditions, including in the case of asymmetric oceans. Existing models are limited to either spherical symmetry or assume an ocean with infinite conductivity. In this work, we use a perturbation method to derive a semi-analytic result capable of determining the induced magnetic moments for an arbitrary layered body, provided each layer is nearly spherical. Crucially, we find that degree-2 tidal deformation results in changes to the induced dipole moments. We demonstrate application of our results to models of plausible asymmetry from the literature within the oceans of Europa and Miranda and the ionospheres of Callisto and Triton. For the models we consider, we find that in the asymmetric case, the induced magnetic field differs by more than 2nT near the surface of Europa, 0.25- 0 . 5nT at 1 R above Miranda and Triton, and is essentially unchanged for Callisto. For Miranda and Triton, this difference is as much as 20%-30% of the induced field magnitude. If measurements near the moons can be made precisely to better than a few tenths of a nT, these values may be used by future spacecraft investigations to characterize asymmetry within the interior of icy moons.",

The changes in EEJ (\u0394EEJ) vary significantly with local time. \u0394EEJ flows westward at dawn and is gradually enhanced to eastward at dusk. The eastward \u0394EEJ at post-noon might be driven indirectly by the upward electric field associated with SAPS electric field at SAPS channel, whereas \u0394EEJ at pre-noon might be directly attributed to the penetrating SAPS-related polarization electric field. Under stronger geomagnetic forcing, a stronger intensity of westward \u0394EEJ at dawn and noon is produced, whereas a stronger eastward \u0394EEJ at dusk is generated because of a faster SAPS velocity.",

Here we demonstrate for the first time a seasonally varying, explicit IMF B<SUB>y</SUB>-dependence of the ring current and Dst index. Using satellite observations and a global magnetohydrodynamic model coupled with a ring current model, we show that for a fixed level of solar wind driving the flux of energetic magnetospheric protons and the growth-rate of the ring current are greater for B<SUB>y</SUB> &lt; 0 (B<SUB>y</SUB> &gt; 0) than for B<SUB>y</SUB> &gt; 0 (B<SUB>y</SUB> &lt; 0) in Northern Hemisphere summer (winter).

The difference in solar illumination of the polar ionosphere during the winter versus summer solstice results in significantly higher conductivity in the summer polar ionosphere. As expected, the currents are larger during the summer than during the winter. The relationship between the electrojets and the Birkeland current systems is essentially constant across seasons, as expected if the ionospheric electrojets close the Birkeland currents. The magnitude of F10.7 is an indicator of the level of solar-generated ionospheric conductance, therefore, one would expect larger ionospheric currents during periods of larger F10.7. This holds true for the summer solstice periods, however, the opposite trend is observed during the winter solstice periods. We provide an explanation for this finding based on the control of the dayside merging rate by the magnetosheath flow pattern.",

      "abstract": "Corotating interaction regions (CIRs) form in the interaction region between the solar-wind high-speed streams and slow streams, leading to compressed plasma and magnetic fields. Using solar-wind measurements upstream of Earth, we identified 290 CIRs encountered by Earth during January 2008 through December 2019 (Solar Cycle 24). The occurrence rate is the maximum during the solar-cycle descending phase (\u224833 year<SUP>\u22121</SUP>), followed by occurrences during solar minimum (\u224824 year<SUP>\u22121</SUP>), the ascending phase (\u224822 year<SUP>\u22121</SUP>), and solar maximum (\u224811 year<SUP>\u22121</SUP>). At 1 AU, CIRs are found to be large-scale interplanetary structures with an average (median) duration of \u224826 hours (\u224824 hours) and radial extent of \u22480.31 AU (\u22480.27 AU). CIRs are characterized by average (median) plasma density of \u224829 cm<SUP>\u22123</SUP> (\u224826 cm<SUP>\u22123</SUP>), ram pressure of \u224811 nPa (\u22489 nPa), temperature of \u22485 \u00d710<SUP>5</SUP> K (\u22484 \u00d710<SUP>5</SUP> K), and magnetic-field magnitude of \u224815 nT (\u224814 nT). The CIR characteristic features exhibit no clear solar-cycle phase dependence. About 30% of the CIRs are found to be geoeffective, causing geomagnetic storms with the peak SYM-H \u2264\u221250 nT; 25% caused moderate storms (\u221250 nT \u2265 SYM-H &gt;\u2212100 nT), and 5% caused intense storms (SYM-H \u2264\u2212100 nT). The geoeffectiveness is found to decrease with the decreasing solar flux. CIRs during equinoxes are found to be more geoeffective compared to those during solstices. On average, SYM-H is strongly associated with the CIR plasma characteristic parameters (anti-correlation coefficient r =\u22120.65 to \u22120.89), while the association is weaker for the AE-index (r =0.41 to 0.67).",

Our focus is on the largest observed/inferred/theoretical cases of sunspot groups, flares on the Sun and Sun-like stars, coronal mass ejections, solar proton events, and geomagnetic storms. The reviewed studies are based on modern observations, historical or long-term data including the auroral and cosmogenic radionuclide record, and Kepler observations of Sun-like stars. We compile a table of 100- and 1000-year events based on occurrence frequency distributions for the space weather phenomena listed above. Questions considered include the Sun-like nature of superflare stars and the existence of impactful but unpredictable solar \"black swans\" and extreme \"dragon king\" solar phenomena that can involve different physics from that operating in events which are merely large.",

      "abstract": "Observation of auroras at low latitudes is an extremely rare event typically associated with major magnetic storms due to intense Earth-directed Coronal Mass Ejections. Since these energetic events represent one of the most important components of space weather, their study is of paramount importance to understand the Sun-Earth connection. Due to the rarity of these events, being able to access all available information for the few cases studied is equally important. Especially if we refer to historical periods in which current accurate observations from ground-based instruments or space were not available. Certainly, among these events, we must include the great aurora of February 4, 1872. An event whose effects have been observed in different regions of the Earth. What we could consider today a global event, especially for its effects on the communication systems of the time, such as the transatlantic cable that allowed a connection between the United States and Europe since 1866. In this paper, we describe the main results of the observations and studies carried out by Angelo Secchi at the Observatory of the Roman College and described in his Memoria sull'Aurora Elettrica del 4 Febbraio 1872 for the Notes of the Pontifical Academy of new Lincei. This note is extremely modern both in its multi-instrumental approach to the study of these phenomena and in its association between solar-terrestrial connection and technological infrastructures on the Earth. The Secchi's note definitely represents the first example of analysis and study of an event on a global scale, such as the Atlantic cable, affecting the Earth. What we nowadays call an extreme space weather event.",

      "abstract": "Space weather alerting systems for power systems require real-time calculations of the electric fields that drive geomagnetically induced currents. In this paper, we present a new method for calculating the Earth impulse response that can be convolved with real-time magnetic field data to give the required electric fields. We start with the Earth transfer function which can be expressed in two ways: as a relationship between the electric field, E, and the geomagnetic field, B, which has characteristics equivalent to that of a high-pass filter, and between E and the time derivative of the magnetic field, dB/dt, which has characteristics of a low-pass filter. An inverse Fourier transform of these transfer functions should then give the corresponding Earth impulse responses in the time domain. This works well for a uniform conductivity model for which the inverse Fourier transform of the transfer function has an analytic solution. However, the inverse Fourier transform of the transfer function for a non-uniform conductivity model requires numerical calculations and produces an acausal impulse response with oscillations because of the Gibbs phenomenon. To investigate the origin of the Gibbs oscillations, the real and imaginary parts of the transfer functions are transformed separately. This shows that the Gibbs oscillations arise from the inverse transform of the real and imaginary parts of the high-pass transfer function and the imaginary part of the low-pass transfer function. A new method is introduced that just transforms the real part of the low-pass transfer function and uses the requirement of causality to construct the full low-pass impulse response. From this, the derivative theorem of convolution is used to obtain the high-pass impulse response. Electric fields can then be calculated by convolution of the low-pass impulse response with the rate of change of the magnetic field, dB/dt, or by convolution of the high-pass impulse response with the magnetic field, B. Tests of the new method by comparison with analytic solutions for specified earth models and synthetic magnetic field data gave very high correlation coefficients, slopes near 1.0 and intercepts near zero, showing the accuracy of the new method. The method can be used with any Earth transfer function whether obtained from magnetotelluric measurements or from 1-D, 2-D or 3-D conductivity models. Thus, it provides a versatile technique that avoids the Gibbs phenomenon and produces a causal impulse response suitable for time domain calculations of electric fields.",

      "abstract": "Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) arise from spatio-temporal changes to Earth's magnetic field which arise from the interaction of the solar wind with Earth's magnetosphere, and drive catastrophic destruction to our technologically dependent society. Hence, computational models to forecast GICs globally with large forecast horizon, high spatial resolution and temporal cadence are of increasing importance to perform prompt necessary mitigation. Since GIC data is proprietary, the time variability of horizontal component of the magnetic field perturbation (dB/dt) is used as a proxy for GICs. In this work, we develop a fast, global dB/dt forecasting model, which forecasts 30 minutes into the future using only solar wind measurements as input. The model summarizes 2 hours of solar wind measurement using a Gated Recurrent Unit, and generates forecasts of coefficients which are folded with a spherical harmonic basis to enable global forecasts. When deployed, our model produces results in under a second, and generates global forecasts for horizontal magnetic perturbation components at 1-minute cadence. We evaluate our model across models in literature for two specific storms of 5 August 2011 and 17 March 2015, while having a self-consistent benchmark model set. Our model outperforms, or has consistent performance with state-of-the-practice high time cadence local and low time cadence global models, while also outperforming/having comparable performance with the benchmark models. Such quick inferences at high temporal cadence and arbitrary spatial resolutions may ultimately enable accurate forewarning of dB/dt for any place on Earth, resulting in precautionary measures to be taken in an informed manner.",

      "abstract": "A study is made of the relations between geomagnetic and geoelectric field variation, Earth-surface impedance, and operational interference (\"anomalies\") experienced on electric-power systems across the contiguous United States during the 13-14 March, 1989, magnetic storm. For this, a 1-min-resolution sequence of geomagnetic field maps is constructed from magnetometer time series acquired at ground-based observatories. Induced geoelectric field maps are calculated by convolving the geomagnetic maps with magnetotelluric impedance tensors. During the storm, anomalies were concentrated where the lithosphere is electrically resistive, and when and where geoelectric field amplitudes were high. This was particularly true in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and the upper Midwest. Few anomalies were experienced in other parts of the Midwest and across much of the West, where the lithosphere is more conductive, and when and where geoelectric field amplitudes were low. Peak 1-min-resolution geoelectric field amplitude ranged from 21.66 V/km in Maine and 19.02 V/km in Virginia to &lt;0.02 V/km in Idaho. Latitude-dependent organization of geoelectric hazards by auroral-zone electrojet currents is detectable, but it is much weaker than geographic organization due to surface impedance. Hazardous geoelectric fields were induced during different storm phases, at different local times, and, by inference, by a variety of ionospheric currents. Compared to geoelectric field amplitudes realized across the United States during March 1989, hazard maps used by utility companies to estimate systems exposure have much less geographic detail and a much smaller maximum-to-minimum range in geoelectric field amplitude. Future research would benefit from denser geomagnetic monitoring, additional magnetotelluric surveying, and access to power-system impact data.",

When, where and why exactly such rapid dB/dt may occur is insufficiently understood. We investigated all storms since 1980 and analyzed the negative and positive dB/dt spikes (&gt;|500| nT/min) in the north and east component using a worldwide coverage (SuperMAG). Our analysis confirmed the existence of two dB/dt spikes \"hotspots\" located in the pre-midnight and in the morning magnetic local time sector, independently of the geographic location of the stations. The associated physical phenomena are probably substorm current wedge onsets and westward traveling surges (WTS) in the evening sector, and wave- or vortex-like current flows in the morning sector known as Omega bands. We observed a spatiotemporal evolution of the negative northern dB/dt spikes. The spikes initially occur in the pre-midnight sector, and then develop in time toward the morning sector. This spatiotemporal sequence is correlated with bursts in the AE index, and can be repeated several times throughout a storm. Finally, we investigated the peak value of Dst and AE during the storm period in comparison with the dB/dt spike occurrence frequency, we did not find any correlation. This result implies that a moderate storm with many spikes can be as (or more) dangerous for ground-based infrastructures than a major storm with fewer dB/dt spikes. Our findings regarding the physical causes and characteristics of dB/dt spikes may help to improve the GIC forecast for the affected regions.",

      "abstract": "An increase in geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) is an inevitable result of geomagnetic field disturbances, and is harmful to the power grid, in particular, at high latitudes. At mid and low latitudes, the amplitude of the GICs is, in general, small, but large-amplitude GICs are often observed during magnetic storms. It is of importance to understand major characteristics and extreme values of GICs at mid and low latitudes. For the geoelectric field disturbances \u0394E observed at Kakioka (27.8\u00b0 geomagnetic latitude) in Japan in 1996-2004, we performed superposed epoch analyses with respect to three types of geomagnetic disturbances: (a) storm sudden commencements (SSCs)/sudden impulses (SIs), (b) main phase of magnetic storms, and (c) bay disturbances. It is shown that the SSCs/SIs and the main phase of the magnetic storms are equally important for causing large-amplitude disturbances of \u0394E at Kakioka. GICs are thought to be amplified when the SIs and/or the bay disturbances occur during the magnetic storms. The maximum value of \u0394E tends to be correlated with the maximum value of \u0394H during the three types of events, where \u0394H is the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field. Assuming that a quasi-linear relationship between the maximum \u0394E and the maximum \u0394H is valid, we estimated GICs at three substations in Japan for an extreme SSCs/SIs, and the extreme magnetic storms. This scheme could be applicable to estimate roughly the GICs against extreme events, and to forecast the maximum GICs in a real-time manner.",

      "abstract": "The International Magnetospheric Study (IMS) took place from 1977 to 1979. An objective was to study the magnetosphere at different heights on the Earth and in space simultaneously. The Scandinavian Magnetometer Array (SMA), where a dense magnetometer array was placed in the northern part of Scandinavia, was part of the IMS. This array extended 1,570 km in north-south and 1,290 km in east-west directions. The SMA-magnetometers contained a camera with 35 mm film and three wire-suspended magnets. These instruments recorded the movement of the magnets optically on the film. The usability of the SMA data has been limited by time-consuming digitization by hand. Thus, most of the recordings has been left nondigitized and unstudied. We have developed a method, named DigiMAG, to digitize the SMA recordings by using a custom-built device. This article presents the high-latitude dynamics of the strongest magnetic storm in 1977 between October 26 and 30. We analyze newly digitized data from Rostadalen (ROS), Evenes (EVE), Ritsemjokk (RIJ), and Kiruna (KIR) stations for the three storm-time substorms on October 26-29, 1977. The results show that in the vicinity of the 65\u00b0 latitude, the storm-time differences of horizontal magnetic components can exceed 500 nT. During the recovery phase of a substorm, 2.8 nT km<SUP>\u22121</SUP> difference arises over a distance of 167 km between the H-component time derivatives of ROS and RIJ stations in 3 minutes.",

      "abstract": "Forecasting ground magnetic field perturbations has been a long-standing goal of the space weather community. The availability of ground magnetic field data and its potential to be used in geomagnetically induced current studies, such as risk assessment, have resulted in several forecasting efforts over the past few decades. One particular community effort was the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) challenge of ground magnetic field perturbations that evaluated the predictive capacity of several empirical and first principles models at both mid- and high-latitudes in order to choose an operative model. In this work, we use three different deep learning models-a feed-forward neural network, a long short-term memory recurrent network and a convolutional neural network-to forecast the horizontal component of the ground magnetic field rate of change (dBH/dt) over 6 different ground magnetometer stations and to compare as directly as possible with the original GEM challenge. We find that, in general, the models are able to perform at similar levels to those obtained in the original challenge, although the performance depends heavily on the particular storm being evaluated. We then discuss the limitations of such a comparison on the basis that the original challenge was not designed with machine learning algorithms in mind.",

      "abstract": "During periods of rapidly changing geomagnetic conditions electric fields form within the Earth's surface and induce currents known as geomagnetically induced currents (GICs), which interact with unprotected electrical systems our society relies on. In this study, we train multi-variate Long-Short Term Memory neural networks to predict magnitude of north-south component of the geomagnetic field (|BN|) at multiple ground magnetometer stations across Alaska provided by the SuperMAG database with a future goal of predicting geomagnetic field disturbances. Each neural network is driven by solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field inputs from the NASA OMNI database spanning from 2000\u20132015 and is fine tuned for each station to maximize the effectiveness in predicting |BN|. The neural networks are then compared against multivariate linear regression models driven with the same inputs at each station using Heidke skill scores with thresholds at the 50, 75, 85, and 99 percentiles for |BN|. The neural network models show significant increases over the linear regression models for |BN| thresholds. We also calculate the Heidke skill scores for d|BN|/dt by deriving d|BN|/dt from |BN| predictions. However, neural network models do not show clear outperformance compared to the linear regression models. To retain the sign information and thus predict BN instead of |BN|, a secondary so-called polarity model is utilized. The polarity model is run in tandem with the neural networks predicting geomagnetic field in a coupled model approach and results in a high correlation between predicted and observed values for all stations. We find this model a promising starting point for a machine learned geomagnetic field model to be expanded upon through increased output time history and fast turnaround times.",

      "abstract": "The prediction of the Dst index is an important subject in space weather. It has significant progress with the prevalent applications of neural networks. The selection of input parameters is critical for the prediction model of the Dst index or other space-weather models. In this study, we perform a layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) method to select the main parameters for the prediction of the Dst index and understand the physical interpretability of neural networks for the first time. Taking an hourly Dst index and 10 types of solar wind parameters as the inputs, we utilize a long short-term memory network to predict the Dst index and present the LRP method to analyze the dependence of the Dst index on these parameters. LRP defines the relevance score for each input, and a higher relevance score indicates that the corresponding input parameter contributes more to the output. The results show that Dst, E <SUB> y </SUB>, B <SUB> z </SUB>, and V are the main control parameters for Dst index prediction. In order to verify the LRP method, we design two more supplementary experiments for further confirmation. These results confirm that the LRP method can reduce the initial dimension of neural network input at the cost of minimum information loss and contribute to the understanding of physical processes in space weather.",

Specifically, the assessment of ground magnetic perturbation in the middle east is of particular interest. More than 20 events including geomagnetic activity types of various orders from 2000 to 2018 are employed in the present work. The study evaluated both geomagnetic indices, real-time magnetic field, and solar wind components measured by the satellites. Detailed investigation and comparison of the data are presented. The B<SUB>z</SUB> and B<SUB>y</SUB> components of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) are investigated. The change of polarity, time duration, maximum amplitude, and characteristics including structures in IMF time series are investigated. The ground magnetic perturbation for several stations in the middle east and their correlation with solar wind properties are discussed. The prediction possibility of magnetic perturbation in the midlatitude is discussed and evaluated. The geomagnetic state variables are taken into account to assess the post-processed indices for analyzing the magnetic anomalies associated with solar winds. A conclusion based on the analyzed data for the prediction of magnetic perturbation in the midlatitude is derived.",

We study the spectral characteristics of GIC measured in Finland and dBx/dt measured 30 km away during the 17 March 2013 intense geomagnetic storm (SymHMin = -132 nT). Two bursts of large GIC (up to 32A) and dBx/dt occurred at \u223c16 UT and 18 UT during the storm main phase. For the first time, the cross wavelet transform (XWT) and wavelet coherence (WTC) techniques are used to investigate the correlation and phase relationship of GIC and dBx/dt in time-frequency domain. Their WTC correlation is strong (over 0.9) over the entire storm period, indicating dBx/dt is the main factor causing GIC. Their XWT spectra show two enclosed periods (8-42 min and 2-42 min) in the high energy region corresponding to the two bursts of activity in GIC and dBx/dt. Morever, we use continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to analyze the spectral characteristics of GIC and dBx/dt. It is found that the CWT and DWT spectra of the two are very similar, especially in the low frequency characteristics, without continuous periodicity. Wavelet coefficients become large when GIC and dBx/dT are large; and the third-order coefficient, which corresponds to low-frequency part, best reflects the disturbance of GIC and dBx/dt.",

However, less is understood about the impact of lower-level geomagnetically induced currents on the health of transformers in the long term. In this study, the long term impact of geomagnetic activity on 13 power station transformers in the UK is investigated. Dissolved gas measurements from 2010 to 2015 were used to look for evidence of a link between degradation of the transformer and heightened levels of the global SYM-H index and dB/dt as measured at Eskdalemuir magnetometer station in southern Scotland. First, case studies of the most significant storms in this time period were examined using dissolved gas analysis methods, specifically the Low Energy Degradation Triangle. These case studies were then augmented with a statistical survey, including Superposed Epoch Analysis of multiple storm events. No evidence of a systematic space weather impact can be found during this time period, likely owing to the relatively quiet nature of the Sun during this epoch and the modernity of the transformers studied.",

Therefore, understanding the responses of power grids to solar superstorms is crucial for space weather research and emergency preparedness purposes. In this work, we combine the Space Weather Modeling Framework with a ground conductivity model and a model of the Chinese Guangdong 500 kV power grid to investigate the response of the whole power grid if the 23 July 2012 solar superstorm had struck the Earth. The maximum |GICs| produced in the power grid by this event reach approximately 400 A, which is more than thrice those measured during a strong magnetic storm with Kp = 8. Based on statistical analyses of the strength and duration of large GICs at 54 substations and a comparison with the GICs responsible for the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec power outage on 13 March 1989, we stipulate that the risk of GICs in the Guangdong 500 kV power grid is very high. The simulation results also reveal that field-aligned currents can play an important role in producing GICs in middle- and low-latitude power grids during solar superstorms. This finding provides crucial insight for understanding the factors that generate strong GICs at middle and low latitudes.",

      "abstract": "Intense geoelectric fields during geomagnetic storms drive geomagnetically induced currents in power grids and other infrastructure, yet there are limited direct measurements of these storm-time geoelectric fields. Moreover, most previous studies examining storm-time geoelectric fields focused on single events or small geographic regions, making it difficult to determine the typical source(s) of intense geoelectric fields. We perform the first comparative analysis of (a) the sources of intense geoelectric fields over multiple geomagnetic storms, (b) using 1-s cadence geoelectric field measurements made at (c) magnetotelluric survey sites distributed widely across the United States. Temporally localized intense perturbations in measured geoelectric fields with prominences (a measure of the relative amplitude of geoelectric field enhancement above the surrounding signal) of at least 500 mV/km were detected during geomagnetic storms with Dst minima (Dst<SUB>min</SUB>) of less than \u2212100 nT from 2006 to 2019. Most of the intense geoelectric fields were observed in resistive regions with magnetic latitudes greater than 55\u00b0 even though we have 167 sites located at lower latitudes during geomagnetic storms of \u2212200 nT \u2264 Dst<SUB>min</SUB> &lt; \u2212100 nT. Our study indicates intense short-lived (&lt;1 min) and geoelectric field perturbations with periods on the order of 1-2 min are common. Most of these perturbations cannot be resolved with 1-min data because they correspond to higher frequency or impulsive phenomena that vary on timescales shorter than that sampling interval. The sources of geomagnetic perturbations inducing these intense geoelectric fields include interplanetary shocks, interplanetary magnetic field turnings, substorms, and ultralow frequency waves.",

      "abstract": "We present a methodology that allows researchers to simulate in real time the spatiotemporal dynamics of the ground electric field (GEF) in a given 3-D conductivity model of the Earth based on continuously augmented data on the spatiotemporal evolution of the inducing source. The formalism relies on the factorization of the source by spatial modes (SM) and time series of respective expansion coefficients and exploits precomputed GEF kernels generated by corresponding SM. To validate the formalism, we invoke a high-resolution 3-D conductivity model of Fennoscandia and consider a realistic source built using the Spherical Elementary Current Systems (SECS) method as applied to magnetic field data from the International Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effect network of observations. The factorization of the SECS-recovered source is then performed using the principal component analysis. Eventually, we show that the GEF computation at a given time instant on a 512 \u00d7 512 grid requires less than 0.025 s provided that GEF kernels due to pre-selected SM are computed in advance. Taking the 7-8 September 2017 geomagnetic storm as a space weather event, we show that real-time high-resolution 3-D modeling of the GEF is feasible. This opens a practical opportunity for GEF (and eventually geomagnetically induced currents) nowcasting and forecasting.",

      "abstract": "Storm sudden commencements (SSC) often precede geomagnetic storms. Commonly, it takes some hours from the step-like change that marks the SSC to the start of the magnetic storm activity. In a subset of cases, however, auroral activity starts almost instantaneously after the SSC. To the authors knowledge, the conditions that enable this rapid activation have not been investigated in detail before. Here we consider all the sudden commencements (SC) during the years 2000-2020. Our focus is on the initial response of the auroral currents on the nightside. For that purpose, we make use of the IMAGE Magnetometer Network in Fennoscandia. In about 30% of SC events an initial activation of the westward electrojet is observed. Magnetic deflections of the northward component, surpassing frequently 1,000 nT, are observed only 4 min after the SC. These intense westward currents, flowing typically in narrow channels of 1\u00b0-2\u00b0 latitudinal width, last some 10 min. The electrojets are conjugate to regions in the magnetosphere near geostationary orbits. In several cases geomagnetic substorm onsets are observed about 30 min after the SC. These start typically at fairly high latitude, around 71\u00b0 magnetic latitude. This is an indication for rather quiet conditions preceding the onset. The magnetic pulse of the SC seems to play an important role in initiating the strong electrojets and the substorms. These initial activities are of relevance for space weather effects because of their strong and rapid variations. This paper provides detailed observations of the initial auroral activity following some SCs.",

      "abstract": "In response to a solar wind dynamic pressure enhancement, the compression of the magnetosphere generates strong ionospheric signatures and a sharp variation in the ground magnetic field, termed sudden commencement (SC). While such compressions have also been associated with a contraction of the ionospheric polar cap due to the triggering of reconnection in the magnetotail, the effect of any changes in dayside reconnection is less clear and is a key component in fully understanding the system response. In this study, we explore the time-dependent nature of dayside coupling during SC by performing global simulations using the Gorgon magnetohydrodynamic code and impact the magnetosphere with a series of interplanetary shocks with different parameters. We identify the location and evolution of the reconnection region in each case as the shock propagates through the magnetosphere, finding strong enhancement in the dayside reconnection rate and prompt expansion of the dayside polar cap prior to the eventual triggering of tail reconnection. This effect pervades for a variety of interplanetary magnetic field orientations, and the reconnection rate is most enhanced for events with higher dynamic pressure. We explain this by repeating the simulations with a large explicit resistivity, showing that compression of the magnetosheath plasma near the propagating shock front allows for reconnection of much greater intensity and at different locations on the dayside magnetopause than during typical solar wind conditions. The results indicate that the dynamic behavior of dayside coupling may render steady models of reconnection inaccurate during the onset of a severe space weather event.",

In this paper, we introduce a new probabilistic model based on the concept of adaptive delta modulation and optimum state space to analyze, identify and characterize the patterns enfolded in the layers of the 1-h Dst index and then predict Dst data using these patterns. The study reveals some significant insights. The exact dimension M of the optimum state space for the Dst index is found to be at M = 10. Also, the series is a combination of multiple distinguished repeating and non-repeating patterns, denoting a high degree of predictability of the Mth data of the series from its previous (M-1) binary data. Eventually, the simulated output of the probabilistic model exhibits a high value of correlation coefficient with the real-time Dst index. Interestingly, the technique only requires the Dst index data as an input of the probabilistic model and is found to be very effective for the entire 24th solar cycle.",

GPS observables derived from dual-frequency receivers over western Nepal (Simikot, Bhimchula, and Nepalganj) are processed to obtain the experimental vTEC utilizing Gopi's and Ciraolo's calibration procedures. The monthly and seasonal behavior of vTEC obtained from each calibration technique is compared with the vTEC obtained from the NeQ-2 model during a quiet period. It is observed that the vTEC value obtained from all studied approaches started to increase from 00:00 Universal Time (UT = Local Time(LT) +5:45), reached a maximum around 08:00 UT (13:45 LT), followed by a decrease, attaining a minimum value around 23:00 UT (4:45 LT). Moreover, a comparative study showed that vTEC computed using the Ciraolo calibration technique overestimates GPS vTEC, calculated in all hours and months by Gopi's approach. In the Spring and Summer, vTEC derived using Ciraolo's TEC calibration overestimates NeQ-2 and underestimates it in the Autumn and Winter. It is found that NeQ-2 model vTEC is favorably associated with GPS vTEC obtained using the Gopi procedure in Spring and correlates with the Ciraolo technique in Autumn. Two GPS vTEC estimations demonstrate superior consistency in the Summer and Winter seasons over the region of Nepal. It is found that the mean absolute difference between NeQ-2 prediction and GPS vTEC procured through the Gopi approach is less on the storm event day. By contrast, it is discovered less by the Ciraolo technique when the storm is recovering (except for a few cases).",

      "abstract": "The need for accurate assessment of the geomagnetic hazard to power systems is driving a requirement to model geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) in multiple voltage levels of a power network. The Lehtinen-Pirjola method for modelling GIC is widely used but was developed when the main aim was to model GIC in only the highest voltage level of a power network. Here we present a modification to the Lehtinen-Pirjola (LP) method designed to provide an efficient method for modelling GIC in multiple voltage levels. The LP method calculates the GIC flow to ground from each node. However, with a network involving multiple voltage levels, many of the nodes are ungrounded, i.e. have infinite resistance to ground, which is numerically inconvenient. The new modified Lehtinen-Pirjola (LPm) method replaces the earthing impedance matrix [Z<SUP>e</SUP>] with the corresponding earthing admittance matrix [Y<SUP>e</SUP>] in which the ungrounded nodes have zero admittance to ground. This is combined with the network admittance matrix [Y<SUP>n</SUP>] to give a combined matrix ([Y<SUP>n</SUP>] + [Y<SUP>e</SUP>]), which is a sparse symmetric positive definite matrix allowing efficient techniques, such as Cholesky decomposition, to be used to provide the nodal voltages. The nodal voltages are then used to calculate the GIC in the transformer windings and the transmission lines of the power network. The LPm method with Cholesky decomposition also provides an efficient method for calculating GIC at multiple time steps. Finally, the paper shows how software for the LP method can be easily converted to the LPm method and provides examples of calculations using the LPm method.",

The propagation characteristics of CMEs in the Corona and interplanetary space determine whether, when and how the CME will hit the Earth. To this end, a lot of progress has been made both on observational and numerical studies of CMEs. With the development of the advanced observational, theoretical and numerical methods, there emerges more and more research on the morphology, the kinematic evolution, the prediction of the arrival at 1 AU and the acceleration/deceleration processes of CMEs. Moreover, many direct observations and simulations have revealed that the CMEs may not propagate along a straight trajectory both in the corona and interplanetary space. Both observational and numerical studies have shown that, when two or more CMEs collide with each other, their kinematic characteristics may change significantly. Here, we present a review of the recent progress associated with the different aspects of CMEs, including their interplanetary counterparts ICMEs, especially focusing on the initiation of the CME, the CMEs' propagation characteristics, interaction with the background solar wind structures, the deflection of the CMEs, the interaction between successive CMEs, the particle acceleration associated with successive CMEs' interaction, and the effect of compound events on Earth's magnetosphere.",

The reviewed studies are based on modern observations, historical or long-term data including the auroral and cosmogenic radionuclide record, and Kepler observations of Sun-like stars. We compile a table of 100- and 1000-year events based on occurrence frequency distributions for the space weather phenomena listed above.

      "abstract": "In this review we focus on the fundamental theory of magnetohydrodynamic reconnection, together with applications to understanding a wide range of dynamic processes in the solar corona, such as flares, jets, coronal mass ejections, the solar wind and coronal heating. We summarise only briefly the related topics of collisionless reconnection, non-thermal particle acceleration, and reconnection in systems other than the corona. We introduce several preliminary topics that are necessary before the subtleties of reconnection can be fully described: these include null points (Sects. 2.1-2.2), other topological and geometrical features such as separatrices, separators and quasi-separatrix layers (Sects. 2.3, 2.6), the conservation of magnetic flux and field lines (Sect. 3), and magnetic helicity (Sect. 4.6). Formation of current sheets in two- and three-dimensional fields is reviewed in Sect. 5. These set the scene for a discussion of the definition and properties of reconnection in three dimensions that covers the conditions for reconnection, the failure of the concept of a flux velocity, the nature of diffusion, and the differences between two-dimensional and three-dimensional reconnection (Sect. 4). Classical 2D models are briefly presented, including magnetic annihilation (Sect. 6), slow and fast regimes of steady reconnection (Sect. 7), and non-steady reconnection such as the tearing mode (Sect. 8). Then three routes to fast reconnection in a collisional or collisionless medium are described (Sect. 9). The remainder of the review is dedicated to our current understanding of how magnetic reconnection operates in three dimensions and in complex magnetic fields such as that of the Sun's corona. In Sects. 10-12, 14.1 the different regimes of reconnection that are possible in three dimensions are summarised, including at a null point, separator, quasi-separator or a braid. The role of 3D reconnection in solar flares (Sect. 13) is reviewed, as well as in coronal heating (Sect. 14), and the release of the solar wind (Sect. 15.2). Extensions including the role of reconnection in the magnetosphere (Sect. 15.3), the link between reconnection and turbulence (Sect. 16), and the role of reconnection in particle acceleration (Sect. 17) are briefly mentioned.",

      "abstract": "The responses of two High-Intensity Long-Duration Continuous AE Activity (HILDCAA) events are investigated using solar wind observations at L1, magnetospheric measurements at geosynchronous orbit, and changes in the global ionosphere. This study provides evidence of the existence of quasi-periodic oscillations (1.5-2 h) in the ionospheric electric field over low latitudes, total electron content at high latitudes, the magnetic field over the globe, energetic electron flux and magnetic field at geosynchronous orbit, geomagnetic indices (SYM-H, AE, and PC) and the Y-component of the interplanetary electric field (IEFy) during the HILDCAA events at all local times. Based on detailed wavelet and cross-spectrum analyses, it is shown that the quasi-periodic oscillation of 1.5-2 h in IEFy is the most effective one that controls the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling process during the HILDCAA events for several days. Therefore, this investigation for the first time, shows that the HILDCAA event affects the global magnetosphere-ionosphere system with a \"quasi-resonant\" mode of oscillation.",

      "abstract": "The preliminary impulse of the sudden commencement is simply explained by the generation of the compressional wave due to sudden compression of the dayside magnetopause and mode conversion from the compressional wave to the Alfv\u00e9n wave in the magnetosphere. However, this simple model cannot explain a time delay of the peak displacement and longer duration time in the higher latitudes in the pre-noon and post-noon sectors of the polar region. Based on the global magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system reveals that this peculiar behavior of the geomagnetic variation of the preliminary impulse is associated with temporal deformation of the ionospheric field-aligned current distribution of the preliminary impulse into a crescent shape; its lower-latitude edge extends toward the anti-sunward direction, and its higher-latitude edge almost stays on the same longitude near noon. Numerical simulations revealed that the deformation of the field-aligned current distribution is derived from different behaviors of the two current systems of the preliminary impulse. The first current system consists of the field-aligned current connected to the field-aligned current of the preliminary impulse in the lower latitude side of the ionosphere, the cross-magnetopause current, and the magnetosheath current (type L current system). The cross-magnetopause current is the inertia current generated in the acceleration front of the solar wind due to the sudden compression of the magnetosheath. Thus, the longitudinal speed of the type L current system in the ionosphere is the solar wind speed in the magnetosheath projected into the ionosphere. In contrast, the current system of the preliminary impulse connected to the field-aligned current of the preliminary impulse at higher latitude (type H current system) consists of the upward/downward field-aligned current in the pre-noon/post-noon sector, respectively, and dawn-to-dusk field-perpendicular current along the dayside magnetopause. The dawn-to-dusk field-perpendicular current moves to the higher latitudes in the outer magnetosphere over time. The field-aligned current of the type H current system is converted from the field-perpendicular current due to convergence of the return field-perpendicular current heading toward the sunward direction in the outer magnetosphere; the return field-perpendicular current is the inertia current driven by the magnetospheric plasma flow associated with compression of the magnetopause behind the front region of the accelerated solar wind. The acceleration front spreads concentrically from the subsolar point. Consequently, as the return field-perpendicular current is converted to the field-aligned current of the type H current system, it does not move much in the longitudinal direction over time because the dawn-to-dusk field-perpendicular current of the type H current system moves to the higher latitudes. Therefore, the high-latitude edge of the current distribution of the preliminary impulse in the ionosphere moves only slightly. Finally, we clarified that the conversion between field-perpendicular current and field-aligned current of the type L current system mainly occurs in the region where the Alfv\u00e9n speed starts to increase toward the Earth. A region with a steep gradient of the Alfv\u00e9n speed like the plasmapause is not always necessary for conversion from the field-perpendicular current to the field-aligned current. We also suggest the possible field-aligned structure of the standing Alfv\u00e9n wave that may occur in the preliminary impulse phase.",

      "abstract": "Very low frequency wave intensity variations measured by the Kannuslehto station, Finland in the frequency range 0-12 kHz between 2016 and 2020 are analyzed by the principal component analysis (PCA). As the analyzed ground-based measurements are basically continuous, the length of individual basis vectors entering into PCA is fundamentally arbitrary. To better characterize both long- and short-period variations, two PCAs with different lengths of the basis vectors are eventually performed. Specifically, either daily frequency-time spectrograms or individual frequency spectra are chosen as the PCA basis vectors. Analysis of the first three principal components shows substantial variations of the wave intensity due to seasonal and local time effects. Intensity variations related to the geomagnetic activity characterized by Kp and AE indices and standard deviation of the magnetic field magnitude are less significant. Moreover, PCA allows one to distinguish between nighttime and daytime Kannuslehto variations and study them independently. Solar and geomagnetic activity effects on the daytime and nighttime measurements are discussed. Wave intensity variations related to substorm occurrence are also analyzed.",

To achieve these objectives, during a stay in circum-Martian space over about 3 years MMX will collect samples from Phobos along with close-up observations of this inner moon and carry out multiple flybys of Deimos to make comparative observations of this outer moon. Simultaneously, successive observations of the Martian atmosphere will also be made by utilizing the advantage of quasi-equatorial spacecraft orbits along the moons' orbits.",

      "abstract": "A spectrogram of Power Line Harmonic Radiation (PLHR) consists of a set of lines with frequency spacing corresponding exactly to 50 or 60 Hz. It is distinct from a spectrogram of Magnetospheric Line Radiation (MLR) where the lines are not equidistant and drift in frequency. PLHR and MLR propagate in the ionosphere and the magnetosphere and are recorded by ground experiments and satellites. If the source of PLHR is evident, the origin of the MLR is still under debate and the purpose of this paper is to understand how MLR lines are formed. The ELF waves triggered by High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) in the ionosphere are used to simulate lines (pulses of different lengths and different frequencies). Several receivers are utilized to survey the propagation of these pulses. The resulting waves are simultaneously recorded by ground-based experiments close to HAARP in Alaska, and by the low-altitude satellite DEMETER either above HAARP or its magnetically conjugate point. Six cases are presented which show that 2-hop echoes (pulses going back and forth in the magnetosphere) are very often observed. The pulses emitted by HAARP return in the Northern hemisphere with a time delay. A detailed spectral analysis shows that sidebands can be triggered and create elements with superposed frequency lines which drift in frequency during the propagation. These elements acting like quasi-periodic emissions are subjected to equatorial amplification and can trigger hooks and falling tones. At the end all these known physical processes lead to the formation of the observed MLR by HAARP pulses. It is shown that there is a tendency for the MLR frequencies of occurrence to be around 2 kHz although the exciting waves have been emitted at lower and higher frequencies.",

      "abstract": "Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) plans a Phobos sample return mission (MMX: Martian Moons eXploration). In this study, we review the related works on the past climate of Mars, its evolution, and the present climate and weather to describe the scientific goals and strategies of the MMX mission regarding the evolution of the Martian surface environment. The MMX spacecraft will retrieve and return a sample of Phobos regolith back to Earth in 2029. Mars ejecta are expected to be accumulated on the surface of Phobos without being much shocked. Samples from Phobos probably contain all types of Martian rock from sedimentary to igneous covering all geological eras if ejecta from Mars could be accumulated on the Phobos surface. Therefore, the history of the surface environment of Mars can be restored by analyzing the returned samples. Remote sensing of the Martian atmosphere and monitoring ions escaping to space while the spacecraft is orbiting Mars in the equatorial orbit are also planned. The camera with multi-wavelength filters and the infrared spectrometer onboard the spacecraft can monitor rapid transport processes of water vapor, dust, ice clouds, and other species, which could not be traced by the previous satellites on the sun-synchronous polar orbit. Such time-resolved pictures of the atmospheric phenomena should be an important clue to understand both the processes of water exchange between the surface/underground reservoirs and the atmosphere and the drivers of efficient material transport to the upper atmosphere. The mass spectrometer with unprecedented mass resolution can observe ions escaping to space and monitor the atmospheric escape which has made the past Mars to evolve towards the cold and dry surface environment we know today. Together with the above two instruments, it can potentially reveal what kinds of atmospheric events can transport tracers (e.g., H<SUB>2</SUB>O) upward and enhance the atmospheric escape.",

This imager used radio waves reflected from the Earth's ionization layer to phase image waves on/in the ionosphere. Two sets of waves were found, one having a constant frequency and another having a large spike. The constant frequency waves represent a continuously active ionospheric disturbance such as a power generating station. The large spike waves were randomly occurring outliers. Candidates for the spike waves are lightning strikes and/or earthquakes. Having the capability to detect these waves opens up the possibility of measuring the power, energy and location of their disturbance.",

The results of analysis demonstrate that the mean level of correlation between the E<SUB>KL</SUB> field and PC index remains in range R = 0.85-0.90 over 24 years. During the solar maximum epochs (2008, 2015) the correlation between E<SUB>KL</SUB> and PC reduced down to R = 0.75, the decrease being related to solar protons events (SPE), which strongly affect the ionospheric conductivity in polar caps. In the course of both cycles the daily AL index well correlated with PC index (R = 0.93) and with E<SUB>KL</SUB> field (R = 0.83); correlation of daily Dst index with PC and EKL values was much worse (R = 0.72 and 0.64, correspondingly), the correlation being independent of solar activity epochs and cycles. The PC indices in northern (PCN) and southern (PCS) indices hemispheres demonstrate the evident seasonal variation; the PCsummer index is commonly larger than the PCwinter index, but PCwinter index better correlates with E<SUB>KL</SUB> field. The conclusion is made that relationships between the E<SUB>KL</SUB> field, PC index, and the magnetic disturbance indices AL and Dst remained valid in course of 23rd and 24th solar cycles and, therefore, the calibrating coefficients, determining these relationships, are not affected by solar activity.",

We show a possibility to use all the available suite of ground-based instrumentation recording cosmic rays (global network of the neutron monitors located at different locations and altitudes, ground- and underground-based muon telescopes, etc.) for such studies without involving the data from aerologic atmospheric sounding. As a demonstration of the method functionality, we provide the calculation results for the variations in the isotropic flux, pitch angle anisotropy of primary cosmic rays in the interplanetary space, changes in the planetary system of geomagnetic cutoff rigidities for every observational hour, as well as the atmosphere temperature above the point of observation of cosmic ray charged components for selected time intervals.",

      "abstract": "Surface-bound exospheres facilitate volatile migration across the surfaces of nearly airless bodies. However, such transport requires that the body can both form and retain an exosphere. To form a sublimation exosphere requires the surface of a body to be sufficiently warm for surface volatiles to sublime; to retain an exosphere, the ballistic escape and photodestruction rates and other loss mechanisms must be sufficiently low. Here we construct a simple free molecular model of exospheres formed by volatile desorption or sublimation. We consider the conditions for forming and retaining exospheres for common volatile species across the Solar System, and explore how three processes (desorption/sublimation, ballistic loss, and photodestruction) shape exospheric dynamics on airless bodies. Our model finds that the CO<SUB>2</SUB> exosphere of Callisto is much too dense to be sustained by impact-delivered volatiles, but could be maintained by only ~7 ha (~0.07 km<SUP>2</SUP>) of exposed CO<SUB>2</SUB> ice distributed across Callisto (and refreshed through mass wasting). We use our model to predict the peak surface locations of Callisto's CO<SUB>2</SUB> exosphere along with other Galilean moons, which could be tested by JUICE observations. Our model finds that to maintain Iapetus' two-tone appearance, its dark Cassini Regio likely has unresolved exposures of water ice, perhaps in sub-resolution impact craters, that amount to up to approximately ~0.06% of its surface. In the Uranian system, we find that the CO<SUB>2</SUB> deposits on Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon are unlikely to have been delivered via impacts, but are consistent with both a magnetospheric origin, (as has been previously suggested) or sourced endogenously. We suggest that the leading/trailing CO<SUB>2</SUB> asymmetries on these moons could result from exosphere-mediated volatile transport, and may be a seasonal equinox feature that could be largely erased by pole-to-pole volatile migration during the Uranian solstices. We calculate that ~2.4-6.4 mm thick layer of CO<SUB>2</SUB> (depending the moon) could migrate about the surface of Uranus' large moons during a seasonal cycle. Our model also confirms that water migration to Mercury's polar cold traps is inefficient without self-shield against photodestroying UV light, and that Callisto's bright spires could be formed/maintained by exospherically deposited H<SUB>2</SUB>O.",

In this regard, single and multi-soliton solutions of modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation for dust ion acoustic waves (DIAWs) have been investigated implementing Hirota's bilinear method. Plasma parameters affecting the amplitude of dust ion acoustic (DIA) mKdV single soliton have been thoroughly investigated based on the data from Saturn's magnetosphere. The overtaking interaction of two mKdV solitons has been investigated by changing the percentage of propagation vectors to observe bipolar structure reducing to a single humped structure for a particular value of the ratio of propagation vectors. The most significant outcome of this study has been the investigation of interaction of a compressive and rarefactive dust ion acoustic soliton forming a peculiar composite shape at the interaction point.",

      "abstract": "The nearby M dwarf WX UMa has recently been detected at radio wavelengths with LOFAR. The combination of its observed brightness temperature and circular polarization fraction suggests that the emission is generated via the electron-cyclotron maser instability. Two distinct mechanisms have been proposed to power such emission from low-mass stars: either a sub-Alfv\u00e9nic interaction between the stellar magnetic field and an orbiting planet, or reconnection at the edge of the stellar magnetosphere. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of both mechanisms, utilizing the information about the star's surrounding plasma environment obtained from modelling its stellar wind. Using this information, we show that a Neptune-sized exoplanet with a magnetic field strength of 10-100 G orbiting at ~0.034 au can accurately reproduce the observed radio emission from the star, with a corresponding orbital period of 7.4 d. Due to the stellar inclination, a planet in an equatorial orbit is unlikely to transit the star. While such a planet could induce radial velocity semi-amplitudes from 7 to 396 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>, it is unlikely that this signal could be detected with current techniques due to the activity of the host star. The application of our planet-induced radio emission model here illustrates its exciting potential as a new tool for identifying planet-hosting candidates from long-term radio monitoring. We also develop a model to investigate the reconnection-powered emission scenario. While this approach produces less favourable results than the planet-induced scenario, it nevertheless serves as a potential alternative emission mechanism which is worth exploring further.",

It has been found that in the case of fair weather conditions, GLE events enhance the atmospheric electrical conductivity, reduce the columnar resistance, and modify the fair weather electric field, air-earth conduction current, and possibly the Ionospheric Potential (IP) in a way that depends on the geomagnetic cut-off rigidity of the location and the altitude. If a dust particle layer is present, GLE events tend to cancel its electrical effects in the ambient atmosphere. This means that the enhancement of the electric field and the reduction of atmospheric electrical conductivity, caused by the ion attachment to dust particles, not only tend to return to their ambient fair weather values, but they can be further modified as if the dust layer was not present. Finally, in terms of dust particles' electrical properties, GLE events tend to modify the ion attachment mechanism, and in principle, the particle net charge, and the electric field \"sensed\" by them, increase. Nevertheless, since the electrical force magnitude is up to six orders of magnitude less than gravity, the increase of the particles' electrical properties is not sufficient to modify the particle settling dynamics and settling velocities.",

The observations are conducted over a fixed longitude (\u223c117\u00b0W geographic) during May 27-31, 2017 (duration with intense geomagnetic storm without any significant solar flare event), September 3-6, 2017 (duration with solar flare events), September 7-16, 2017 (duration with intense to moderate solar flares as well as geomagnetic storms) and November 28-30, 2020 (duration with a moderate solar flare event with no geomagnetic storm in association). It is found that the effects were the highest during May 27-31, 2017 among all of these events. From the observations of super-imposed effects of the geophysical events, it was found that the effects of an X-class solar flare on September 10-12, 2017 on mid-latitude ionization were suppressed by the Disturbed Dynamo Electric Field (DDEF) from high latitudes during the recovery phase of an intense CME driven geomagnetic storm. The weak effects were also explained by the position of origination of the flare at the Sun. Correlations were observed between the variations in O/N<SUB>2</SUB>, neutral wind velocities and the mid and high latitude Total Electron Content (TEC) during these periods. Possible explanation is given for those few cases (for example, September 14, 2017) when the variations in O/N<SUB>2</SUB> mismatched with the local TEC especially in the mid-latitudes. The effects of the solar flare event on November 28-30, 2020 which were short-lived have also been also observed at locations near the subsolar point from low latitudes in the southern hemisphere.",

      "abstract": "The archetypical flare star UV Cet was observed by MeerKAT on 5-6 October 2021. A large radio outburst with a duration of $\\sim\\!2$ hr was observed between 886-1682 MHz with a time resolution of 8s and a frequency resolution of 0.84 MHz, enabling sensitive dynamic spectra to be formed. The emission is characterized by three peaks containing a multitude of broadband arcs or partial arcs in the time-frequency domain. In general, the arcs are highly right-hand circularly polarized. During end of the third peak, brief bursts occur that are significantly elliptically polarized. We present a simple model that appears to be broadly consistent with the characteristics of the radio emission from UV Cet. Briefly, the stellar magnetic field is modeled as a dipole aligned with the rotational axis of the star. The radio emission mechanism is assumed to be due to the cyclotron maser instability where x-mode radiation near the electron gyrofrequency is amplified. While the elliptically polarized bursts may be intrinsic to the source, rather stringent limits are imposed on the plasma density in the source and along the propagation path. We suggest that the elliptically polarized radiation may instead be the result of reflection on an over-dense plasma structure at some distance from the source. Radio emission from UV~Cet shares both stellar and planetary attributes.",

      "abstract": "The direct role of successive intense magnetospheric substorms in injecting/energizing particles into the storm-time ring current is still debated and controversial. Whereas in the recent past it has been observed the absence of a net information flow between magnetic storms and substorms, previous in-situ satellite observations have evidenced that ionospheric-origin ions dominate the population of the ring current during the main phase of geomagnetic storms. As a matter of fact, the controversy arises mainly by the use of sophisticated data-driven techniques somewhat contradicting in-situ measurements. In this framework, the main aim of this work is to attempt an adaption of the powerful information-theoretic approach, i.e., the transfer entropy, in a consistent way with physics modeling and observations and to explore the possible motivations behind the underlying contradictions that emerge when these techniques are used. Our idea is to characterize the dynamics of the information flow within the magnetosphere-ionosphere system using a database of geomagnetic storms instead of considering a long time series of geomagnetic indices. This allows us to consider local non-stationary features of the information flow and, most importantly, to follow the transition from quiet to disturbed periods and vice-versa.",

These include temperature anisotropies, tails (kurtosis), and reflectional asymmetries (skewness), which contribute a significant heat flux to the solar wind. If these non-equilibrium features are sufficiently strong, they drive kinetic micro-instabilities. We develop a semi-graphical framework based on the equations of quasi-linear theory to describe electron-driven instabilities in the solar wind. We apply our framework to resonant instabilities driven by temperature anisotropies. These include the electron whistler anisotropy instability and the propagating electron firehose instability. We then describe resonant instabilities driven by reflectional asymmetries in the electron distribution function. These include the electron/ion-acoustic, kinetic Alfv\u00e9n heat-flux, Langmuir, electron-beam, electron/ion-cyclotron, electron/electron-acoustic, whistler heat-flux, oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler, lower-hybrid fan, and electron-deficit whistler instability. We briefly comment on non-resonant instabilities driven by electron temperature anisotropies such as the mirror-mode and the non-propagating firehose instability. We conclude our review with a list of open research topics in the field of electron-driven instabilities in the solar wind.",

      "abstract": "The dynamics of the Earth's magnetosphere presents dynamical complexity during magnetospheric substorms and geomagnetic storms. This complex dynamics comprises both stochastic and deterministic features occurring at different timescales. Here we investigate the stochastic nature of the magnetospheric substorm dynamics by analysing the Markovian character of the SuperMAG SME geomagnetic index, used as a proxy of the magnetospheric dynamics during magnetospheric substorms. In detail, performing the Chapman-Kolmogorov test, the SME dynamics appears to satisfy the Markov condition at scales below 200 minutes. The Kramer-Moyal analysis instead highlights that a purely diffusive process is not representative of the magnetospheric dynamics. Thus, a model comprising both diffusion and Poisson-jump processes is used to reproduce the SME dynamical features at small scales. A discussion of the similarities and differences between this model and the actual SME properties is provided with a special emphasis on the metastability of the Earth's magnetospheric dynamics. Finally, the relevance of our results in the framework of Space Weather is also addressed.",

      "abstract": "When the first CubeSats were launched nearly two decades ago, few people believed that the miniature satellites would likely prove to be a useful scientific tool. Skeptics abounded. However, the last decade has seen the highly successful implementation of space missions that make creative and innovative use of fast-advancing CubeSat and small satellite technology to carry out important science experiments and missions. Several projects now have used CubeSats to obtain first-of-their-kind observations and findings that have formed the basis for high-profile engineering and science publications, thereby establishing without doubt the scientific value and broad utility of CubeSats. In this paper, we describe recent achievements and lessons learned from a representative selection of successful CubeSat missions with a space weather focus. We conclude that these missions were successful in part because their limited resources promoted not only mission focus but also appropriate risk-taking for comparatively high science return. Quantitative analysis of refereed publications from these CubeSat missions and several larger missions reveals that mission outcome metrics compare favorably when publication number is normalized by mission cost or if expressed as a weighted net scientific impact of all mission publications.",

      "abstract": "Solar jets are ubiquitous transient collimated mass outflows in the solar atmosphere over a wide range of sizes from small scale nanojets to a few solar radii, embedded in the solar chromosphere to solar corona. Jets are frequently accompanied by solar flares and these flares provide the force to propagate the plasma material upward and could be accompanied by coronal mass ejections. These jets could act as a source for transporting a significant mass and energy from the lower solar atmosphere to the upper coronal heights and consequently heating the solar corona and accelerating the solar wind. Magnetic reconnection is believed to be the triggering reason behind these jet activity. The thesis entitled: Study of Solar Jets and Related Flares, includes various case studies with different mechanisms to set off the jet initiation, associated large scale eruptions and mounts strong observational evidences to validate the numerical experiments for the magnetic flux emergence models. Such studies on solar jets along with their magnetic origin contribute to resolve the scandalous coronal heating problem and provide the evidences for the existing theoretical models and open a new window for the interplanetary science.",

The reviewed studies are based on modern observations, historical or long-term data including the auroral and cosmogenic radionuclide record, and Kepler observations of Sun-like stars. We compile a table of 100- and 1000-year events based on occurrence frequency distributions for the space weather phenomena listed above.

This study provides evidence of the existence of quasi-periodic oscillations (1.5-2 h) in the ionospheric electric field over low latitudes, total electron content at high latitudes, the magnetic field over the globe, energetic electron flux and magnetic field at geosynchronous orbit, geomagnetic indices (SYM-H, AE, and PC) and the Y-component of the interplanetary electric field (IEFy) during the HILDCAA events at all local times. Based on detailed wavelet and cross-spectrum analyses, it is shown that the quasi-periodic oscillation of 1.5-2 h in IEFy is the most effective one that controls the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling process during the HILDCAA events for several days. Therefore, this investigation for the first time, shows that the HILDCAA event affects the global magnetosphere-ionosphere system with a \"quasi-resonant\" mode of oscillation.",

      "abstract": "Periodic tidal ocean currents induce electric currents and, therefore, magnetic field signals that are observable using spaceborne and ground-based observation techniques. In theory, the signals can be used to monitor oceanic temperature and salinity variations. Tidal magnetic field amplitudes and phases have been extracted from magnetometer measurements in the past. However, due to uncertainties caused by a plentitude of influencing factors, the shape and temporal variation of these signals are only known to a limited extent. This study uses past extraction methods to characterize seasonal variations and long-term trends in the ten year magnetometer time series of three coastal island observatories. First, we assess data processing procedures used to prepare ground-based magnetometer observations for tidal ocean dynamo signal extraction to demonstrate that existing approaches, i.e., subtraction of core field models or first-order differencing, are unable to reliably remove low-frequency contributions. We hence propose low-frequency filtering using smoothing splines and demonstrate the advantages over the existing approaches. Second, we determine signal and side peak magnitudes of the M2 tide induced magnetic field signal by spectral analysis of the processed data. We find evidence for seasonal magnetic field signal variations of up to 25 % from the annual mean. Third, to characterize the long-term behavior of tidal ocean dynamo signal amplitudes and phases, we apply different signal extraction techniques to identify tidal ocean-dynamo signal amplitudes and phases in sub-series of the ten-year time series with incrementally increasing lengths. The analyses support three main findings: (1) trends cause signal amplitude changes of up to \u22481 nT and phase changes are in the order of O (10<SUP>\u2218</SUP> ) within the observation period; (2) at least four years of data are needed to obtain reliable amplitude and phase values with the extraction methods used and (3) signal phases are a less dependent on the chosen extraction method than signal amplitudes.",

      "abstract": "The preliminary impulse of the sudden commencement is simply explained by the generation of the compressional wave due to sudden compression of the dayside magnetopause and mode conversion from the compressional wave to the Alfv\u00e9n wave in the magnetosphere. However, this simple model cannot explain a time delay of the peak displacement and longer duration time in the higher latitudes in the pre-noon and post-noon sectors of the polar region. Based on the global magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system reveals that this peculiar behavior of the geomagnetic variation of the preliminary impulse is associated with temporal deformation of the ionospheric field-aligned current distribution of the preliminary impulse into a crescent shape; its lower-latitude edge extends toward the anti-sunward direction, and its higher-latitude edge almost stays on the same longitude near noon. Numerical simulations revealed that the deformation of the field-aligned current distribution is derived from different behaviors of the two current systems of the preliminary impulse. The first current system consists of the field-aligned current connected to the field-aligned current of the preliminary impulse in the lower latitude side of the ionosphere, the cross-magnetopause current, and the magnetosheath current (type L current system). The cross-magnetopause current is the inertia current generated in the acceleration front of the solar wind due to the sudden compression of the magnetosheath. Thus, the longitudinal speed of the type L current system in the ionosphere is the solar wind speed in the magnetosheath projected into the ionosphere. In contrast, the current system of the preliminary impulse connected to the field-aligned current of the preliminary impulse at higher latitude (type H current system) consists of the upward/downward field-aligned current in the pre-noon/post-noon sector, respectively, and dawn-to-dusk field-perpendicular current along the dayside magnetopause. The dawn-to-dusk field-perpendicular current moves to the higher latitudes in the outer magnetosphere over time. The field-aligned current of the type H current system is converted from the field-perpendicular current due to convergence of the return field-perpendicular current heading toward the sunward direction in the outer magnetosphere; the return field-perpendicular current is the inertia current driven by the magnetospheric plasma flow associated with compression of the magnetopause behind the front region of the accelerated solar wind. The acceleration front spreads concentrically from the subsolar point. Consequently, as the return field-perpendicular current is converted to the field-aligned current of the type H current system, it does not move much in the longitudinal direction over time because the dawn-to-dusk field-perpendicular current of the type H current system moves to the higher latitudes. Therefore, the high-latitude edge of the current distribution of the preliminary impulse in the ionosphere moves only slightly. Finally, we clarified that the conversion between field-perpendicular current and field-aligned current of the type L current system mainly occurs in the region where the Alfv\u00e9n speed starts to increase toward the Earth. A region with a steep gradient of the Alfv\u00e9n speed like the plasmapause is not always necessary for conversion from the field-perpendicular current to the field-aligned current. We also suggest the possible field-aligned structure of the standing Alfv\u00e9n wave that may occur in the preliminary impulse phase.",

      "abstract": "The World Magnetic Model (WMM) is a geomagnetic main field model that is widely used for navigation by governments, industry and the general public. In recent years, the model has been derived using high accuracy magnetometer data from the Swarm mission. This study explores the possibility of developing future WMMs in the post-Swarm era using data from the Iridium satellite constellation. Iridium magnetometers are primarily used for attitude control, so they are not designed to produce the same level of accuracy as magnetic data from scientific missions. Iridium magnetometer errors range from 30 nT quantization to hundreds of nT errors due to spacecraft contamination and calibration uncertainty, whereas Swarm measurements are accurate to about 1 nT. The calibration uncertainty in the Iridium measurements is identified as a major error source, and a method is developed to calibrate the spacecraft measurements using data from a subset of the INTERMAGNET observatory network producing quasi-definitive data on a regular basis. After calibration, the Iridium data produced main field models with approximately 20 nT average error and 40 nT maximum error as compared to the CHAOS-7.2 model. For many scientific and precision navigation applications, highly accurate Swarm-like measurements are still necessary, however, the Iridium-based models were shown to meet the WMM error tolerances, indicating that Iridium is a viable data source for future WMMs.",

The event under consideration occurred during the substorm recovery phase and comprised both periodic luminosity variation of the on/off type with repetition periods of 3-6 s (main pulsations) and faster scintillation (approximately 2 Hz) during the \"on\" phase of the main pulsations. It is found that (1) the altitudes of the pulsating auroral arcs decrease during \"on\" intervals from ~ 95 km to ~ 92 km and (2) for two closely spaced arcs, internal modulation took place only in the lowest arc. The results may be interpreted in the frame of the traditional mechanism assuming electron scattering via VLF-wave/particle interaction in the equatorial magnetosphere, while the internal modulation may also be alternatively interpreted in the frame of the less-often inferred mechanism of field-aligned acceleration somewhere between the equatorial plane and ionosphere.",

As the analyzed ground-based measurements are basically continuous, the length of individual basis vectors entering into PCA is fundamentally arbitrary. To better characterize both long- and short-period variations, two PCAs with different lengths of the basis vectors are eventually performed. Specifically, either daily frequency-time spectrograms or individual frequency spectra are chosen as the PCA basis vectors. Analysis of the first three principal components shows substantial variations of the wave intensity due to seasonal and local time effects. Intensity variations related to the geomagnetic activity characterized by Kp and AE indices and standard deviation of the magnetic field magnitude are less significant. Moreover, PCA allows one to distinguish between nighttime and daytime Kannuslehto variations and study them independently. Solar and geomagnetic activity effects on the daytime and nighttime measurements are discussed. Wave intensity variations related to substorm occurrence are also analyzed.",

      "abstract": "A spectrogram of Power Line Harmonic Radiation (PLHR) consists of a set of lines with frequency spacing corresponding exactly to 50 or 60 Hz. It is distinct from a spectrogram of Magnetospheric Line Radiation (MLR) where the lines are not equidistant and drift in frequency. PLHR and MLR propagate in the ionosphere and the magnetosphere and are recorded by ground experiments and satellites. If the source of PLHR is evident, the origin of the MLR is still under debate and the purpose of this paper is to understand how MLR lines are formed. The ELF waves triggered by High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) in the ionosphere are used to simulate lines (pulses of different lengths and different frequencies). Several receivers are utilized to survey the propagation of these pulses. The resulting waves are simultaneously recorded by ground-based experiments close to HAARP in Alaska, and by the low-altitude satellite DEMETER either above HAARP or its magnetically conjugate point. Six cases are presented which show that 2-hop echoes (pulses going back and forth in the magnetosphere) are very often observed. The pulses emitted by HAARP return in the Northern hemisphere with a time delay. A detailed spectral analysis shows that sidebands can be triggered and create elements with superposed frequency lines which drift in frequency during the propagation. These elements acting like quasi-periodic emissions are subjected to equatorial amplification and can trigger hooks and falling tones. At the end all these known physical processes lead to the formation of the observed MLR by HAARP pulses. It is shown that there is a tendency for the MLR frequencies of occurrence to be around 2 kHz although the exciting waves have been emitted at lower and higher frequencies.",

In this study, we review the related works on the past climate of Mars, its evolution, and the present climate and weather to describe the scientific goals and strategies of the MMX mission regarding the evolution of the Martian surface environment. The MMX spacecraft will retrieve and return a sample of Phobos regolith back to Earth in 2029. Mars ejecta are expected to be accumulated on the surface of Phobos without being much shocked. Samples from Phobos probably contain all types of Martian rock from sedimentary to igneous covering all geological eras if ejecta from Mars could be accumulated on the Phobos surface. Therefore, the history of the surface environment of Mars can be restored by analyzing the returned samples. Remote sensing of the Martian atmosphere and monitoring ions escaping to space while the spacecraft is orbiting Mars in the equatorial orbit are also planned. The camera with multi-wavelength filters and the infrared spectrometer onboard the spacecraft can monitor rapid transport processes of water vapor, dust, ice clouds, and other species, which could not be traced by the previous satellites on the sun-synchronous polar orbit. Such time-resolved pictures of the atmospheric phenomena should be an important clue to understand both the processes of water exchange between the surface/underground reservoirs and the atmosphere and the drivers of efficient material transport to the upper atmosphere. The mass spectrometer with unprecedented mass resolution can observe ions escaping to space and monitor the atmospheric escape which has made the past Mars to evolve towards the cold and dry surface environment we know today. Together with the above two instruments, it can potentially reveal what kinds of atmospheric events can transport tracers (e.g., H<SUB>2</SUB>O) upward and enhance the atmospheric escape.",

This imager used radio waves reflected from the Earth's ionization layer to phase image waves on/in the ionosphere. Two sets of waves were found, one having a constant frequency and another having a large spike. The constant frequency waves represent a continuously active ionospheric disturbance such as a power generating station. The large spike waves were randomly occurring outliers. Candidates for the spike waves are lightning strikes and/or earthquakes. Having the capability to detect these waves opens up the possibility of measuring the power, energy and location of their disturbance.",

      "abstract": "The daily values of the E<SUB>KL</SUB> field and indices of magnetic activity PC, AL and Dst were used to verify stability of relationships between these parameters in course of 23rd and 24th solar cycles. The results of analysis demonstrate that the mean level of correlation between the E<SUB>KL</SUB> field and PC index remains in range R = 0.85-0.90 over 24 years. During the solar maximum epochs (2008, 2015) the correlation between E<SUB>KL</SUB> and PC reduced down to R = 0.75, the decrease being related to solar protons events (SPE), which strongly affect the ionospheric conductivity in polar caps. In the course of both cycles the daily AL index well correlated with PC index (R = 0.93) and with E<SUB>KL</SUB> field (R = 0.83); correlation of daily Dst index with PC and EKL values was much worse (R = 0.72 and 0.64, correspondingly), the correlation being independent of solar activity epochs and cycles. The PC indices in northern (PCN) and southern (PCS) indices hemispheres demonstrate the evident seasonal variation; the PCsummer index is commonly larger than the PCwinter index, but PCwinter index better correlates with E<SUB>KL</SUB> field. The conclusion is made that relationships between the E<SUB>KL</SUB> field, PC index, and the magnetic disturbance indices AL and Dst remained valid in course of 23rd and 24th solar cycles and, therefore, the calibrating coefficients, determining these relationships, are not affected by solar activity.",

In this regard, single and multi-soliton solutions of modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation for dust ion acoustic waves (DIAWs) have been investigated implementing Hirota's bilinear method. Plasma parameters affecting the amplitude of dust ion acoustic (DIA) mKdV single soliton have been thoroughly investigated based on the data from Saturn's magnetosphere. The overtaking interaction of two mKdV solitons has been investigated by changing the percentage of propagation vectors to observe bipolar structure reducing to a single humped structure for a particular value of the ratio of propagation vectors. The most significant outcome of this study has been the investigation of interaction of a compressive and rarefactive dust ion acoustic soliton forming a peculiar composite shape at the interaction point.",

      "abstract": "The effect of Ground Level Enhancements (GLEs) on the atmospheric and dust particles electrical properties is studied. It has been found that in the case of fair weather conditions, GLE events enhance the atmospheric electrical conductivity, reduce the columnar resistance, and modify the fair weather electric field, air-earth conduction current, and possibly the Ionospheric Potential (IP) in a way that depends on the geomagnetic cut-off rigidity of the location and the altitude. If a dust particle layer is present, GLE events tend to cancel its electrical effects in the ambient atmosphere. This means that the enhancement of the electric field and the reduction of atmospheric electrical conductivity, caused by the ion attachment to dust particles, not only tend to return to their ambient fair weather values, but they can be further modified as if the dust layer was not present. Finally, in terms of dust particles' electrical properties, GLE events tend to modify the ion attachment mechanism, and in principle, the particle net charge, and the electric field \"sensed\" by them, increase. Nevertheless, since the electrical force magnitude is up to six orders of magnitude less than gravity, the increase of the particles' electrical properties is not sufficient to modify the particle settling dynamics and settling velocities.",

This paper presents a systematic numerical study of the magnetospheric and ionospheric influences on the evolution and modification of FACs, with focus on the role of ionospheric Pedersen conductance and its gradient. FACs are typically generated in the magnetosphere and are carried into the ionosphere by Alfv\u00e9n waves. During their reflection from the ionosphere, these FACs are modified. The nature of modifications depends on the magnitude and distribution of ionospheric Pedersen conductance. A uniform ionosphere, having a high Pedersen conductance, enhances such a magnetospheric FAC strongly. For conductance-gradients perpendicular to the wave-polarization, FACs are generated after the reflection of simple Alfv\u00e9nic perturbations, which are not carrying any FACs. A suitable arrangement of ionospheric Pedersen conductance can create a pair of antiparallel FACs, with consequent generation of a strong Pedersen current at the ionospheric boundary. For conductance-gradients along the polarization of the wave, the steady state velocity perturbation assumes an average value of the imposed Pedersen conductance over the entire region after reflection from the ionosphere. This configuration is comparable to the situation where the Cowling conductance operates.",

The observations are conducted over a fixed longitude (\u223c117\u00b0W geographic) during May 27-31, 2017 (duration with intense geomagnetic storm without any significant solar flare event), September 3-6, 2017 (duration with solar flare events), September 7-16, 2017 (duration with intense to moderate solar flares as well as geomagnetic storms) and November 28-30, 2020 (duration with a moderate solar flare event with no geomagnetic storm in association). It is found that the effects were the highest during May 27-31, 2017 among all of these events. From the observations of super-imposed effects of the geophysical events, it was found that the effects of an X-class solar flare on September 10-12, 2017 on mid-latitude ionization were suppressed by the Disturbed Dynamo Electric Field (DDEF) from high latitudes during the recovery phase of an intense CME driven geomagnetic storm. The weak effects were also explained by the position of origination of the flare at the Sun. Correlations were observed between the variations in O/N<SUB>2</SUB>, neutral wind velocities and the mid and high latitude Total Electron Content (TEC) during these periods. Possible explanation is given for those few cases (for example, September 14, 2017) when the variations in O/N<SUB>2</SUB> mismatched with the local TEC especially in the mid-latitudes. The effects of the solar flare event on November 28-30, 2020 which were short-lived have also been also observed at locations near the subsolar point from low latitudes in the southern hemisphere.",

      "abstract": "The archetypical flare star UV Cet was observed by MeerKAT on 5-6 October 2021. A large radio outburst with a duration of $\\sim\\!2$ hr was observed between 886-1682 MHz with a time resolution of 8s and a frequency resolution of 0.84 MHz, enabling sensitive dynamic spectra to be formed. The emission is characterized by three peaks containing a multitude of broadband arcs or partial arcs in the time-frequency domain. In general, the arcs are highly right-hand circularly polarized. During end of the third peak, brief bursts occur that are significantly elliptically polarized. We present a simple model that appears to be broadly consistent with the characteristics of the radio emission from UV Cet. Briefly, the stellar magnetic field is modeled as a dipole aligned with the rotational axis of the star. The radio emission mechanism is assumed to be due to the cyclotron maser instability where x-mode radiation near the electron gyrofrequency is amplified. While the elliptically polarized bursts may be intrinsic to the source, rather stringent limits are imposed on the plasma density in the source and along the propagation path. We suggest that the elliptically polarized radiation may instead be the result of reflection on an over-dense plasma structure at some distance from the source. Radio emission from UV~Cet shares both stellar and planetary attributes.",

      "abstract": "The direct role of successive intense magnetospheric substorms in injecting/energizing particles into the storm-time ring current is still debated and controversial. Whereas in the recent past it has been observed the absence of a net information flow between magnetic storms and substorms, previous in-situ satellite observations have evidenced that ionospheric-origin ions dominate the population of the ring current during the main phase of geomagnetic storms. As a matter of fact, the controversy arises mainly by the use of sophisticated data-driven techniques somewhat contradicting in-situ measurements. In this framework, the main aim of this work is to attempt an adaption of the powerful information-theoretic approach, i.e., the transfer entropy, in a consistent way with physics modeling and observations and to explore the possible motivations behind the underlying contradictions that emerge when these techniques are used. Our idea is to characterize the dynamics of the information flow within the magnetosphere-ionosphere system using a database of geomagnetic storms instead of considering a long time series of geomagnetic indices. This allows us to consider local non-stationary features of the information flow and, most importantly, to follow the transition from quiet to disturbed periods and vice-versa.",

      "abstract": "The electrons are an essential particle species in the solar wind. They often exhibit non-equilibrium features in their velocity distribution function. These include temperature anisotropies, tails (kurtosis), and reflectional asymmetries (skewness), which contribute a significant heat flux to the solar wind. If these non-equilibrium features are sufficiently strong, they drive kinetic micro-instabilities. We develop a semi-graphical framework based on the equations of quasi-linear theory to describe electron-driven instabilities in the solar wind. We apply our framework to resonant instabilities driven by temperature anisotropies. These include the electron whistler anisotropy instability and the propagating electron firehose instability. We then describe resonant instabilities driven by reflectional asymmetries in the electron distribution function. These include the electron/ion-acoustic, kinetic Alfv\u00e9n heat-flux, Langmuir, electron-beam, electron/ion-cyclotron, electron/electron-acoustic, whistler heat-flux, oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler, lower-hybrid fan, and electron-deficit whistler instability. We briefly comment on non-resonant instabilities driven by electron temperature anisotropies such as the mirror-mode and the non-propagating firehose instability. We conclude our review with a list of open research topics in the field of electron-driven instabilities in the solar wind.",

      "abstract": "The dynamics of the Earth's magnetosphere presents dynamical complexity during magnetospheric substorms and geomagnetic storms. This complex dynamics comprises both stochastic and deterministic features occurring at different timescales. Here we investigate the stochastic nature of the magnetospheric substorm dynamics by analysing the Markovian character of the SuperMAG SME geomagnetic index, used as a proxy of the magnetospheric dynamics during magnetospheric substorms. In detail, performing the Chapman-Kolmogorov test, the SME dynamics appears to satisfy the Markov condition at scales below 200 minutes. The Kramer-Moyal analysis instead highlights that a purely diffusive process is not representative of the magnetospheric dynamics. Thus, a model comprising both diffusion and Poisson-jump processes is used to reproduce the SME dynamical features at small scales. A discussion of the similarities and differences between this model and the actual SME properties is provided with a special emphasis on the metastability of the Earth's magnetospheric dynamics. Finally, the relevance of our results in the framework of Space Weather is also addressed.",

      "abstract": "In the study, we address the mathematical problem of proton migration in the Earth's mantle and suggest a prototype for exploring the Earth's interior to map the effects of superionic proton conduction. The problem can be mathematically solved by deriving the self-consistent electromagnetic field potential U(x,t) and then reconstructing the distribution function f(x, v, t). Reducing the Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations to non-linear sh-Gordon hyperbolic and transport equations, the propagation of a non-linear wavefront within the domain, and transport of the boundary conditions in the form of a non-linear wave are examined. By computing a 3D model and through Fourier-analysis, the spatial and electrical characteristics of potential U(x, t) are investigated. The numerical results are compared to the Fourier transformed quantities of the potential (V) obtained through field observations of the electric potential (Kuznetsov method). The non-stationary solutions for the forced oscillation of a two-component system, and therefore, the oscillatory strengths of two types of charged particles can be usefully addressed by the proposed mathematical model. Moreover, the model, along with data analysis of the electric potential observations and probabilistic seismic hazard maps, can be used to develop an advanced seismic risk metric.",

      "abstract": "When the first CubeSats were launched nearly two decades ago, few people believed that the miniature satellites would likely prove to be a useful scientific tool. Skeptics abounded. However, the last decade has seen the highly successful implementation of space missions that make creative and innovative use of fast-advancing CubeSat and small satellite technology to carry out important science experiments and missions. Several projects now have used CubeSats to obtain first-of-their-kind observations and findings that have formed the basis for high-profile engineering and science publications, thereby establishing without doubt the scientific value and broad utility of CubeSats. In this paper, we describe recent achievements and lessons learned from a representative selection of successful CubeSat missions with a space weather focus. We conclude that these missions were successful in part because their limited resources promoted not only mission focus but also appropriate risk-taking for comparatively high science return. Quantitative analysis of refereed publications from these CubeSat missions and several larger missions reveals that mission outcome metrics compare favorably when publication number is normalized by mission cost or if expressed as a weighted net scientific impact of all mission publications.",

      "abstract": "In this work we implement an analytically derived coupling function between ground-level and primary proton particles for the case of ground-level enhancement events (GLEs). The main motivation for this work is to determine whether this coupling function is suitable for the study of both major cases of cosmic-ray (CR) variation events, namely GLEs and Forbush decreases. This version of the coupling function, which relies on formalism used in quantum field theory (QFT) computations, has already been applied to Forbush decreases yielding satisfactory results. In this study, it is applied to a GLE event that occurred on 10 September 2017. For the analytical derivations, normalized ground-level cosmic-ray data were used from seven neutron-monitor stations with low cutoff rigidities. To assess and evaluate the results for the normalized proton intensity, we benchmark them with the time series for the proton flux, as recorded by the GOES 13 spacecraft during the same time period. The theoretically calculated results for proton energy \u22651 GeV are in general agreement with the recorded data for protons with energy &gt;700 MeV, presenting a least-squares linear best fit with slope 0.75 \u00b10.17 and a Pearson correlation coefficient equal to 0.62. We conclude that the coupling function presented in this work is the first coupling function that is well applicable to both cases of cosmic-ray intensity events, namely GLEs and Forbush decreases.",

It is calculated as the ratio of the vertical total electron content (vTEC) to the ionospheric F2-layer electron density maximum (NmF2). Since its definition dated back in the 60s, a lot of information on the behavior of \u03c4 for different helio-geophysical conditions has been cumulated and the connection with several plasma properties has been also demonstrated. The beginning of the Global Positioning System (GPS) era in the 90s had a strong effect on the studies about \u03c4 because GPS signals allow to obtain the vTEC up to about 20000 km of altitude. Recently, \u03c4 has also found application in many data-assimilation methodologies, especially for the improvement of empirical ionospheric models based on near real-time data. All of these topics are reviewed and discussed in this paper based on the literature published in the last sixty years.",

Interplanetary energetic electrons, mainly consisting of continuous solar wind superhalo electrons and transient solar energetic electron events both with typical power-law energy spectra, can provide a source of energetic electrons to the Earth's magnetosphere. After briefly summarizing recent results of solar wind superhalo electrons and solar energetic electron events, this paper reviews the first evidences for the direct and continuous entry of energetic electrons from the interplanetary medium to the Earth's polar cusp, cap and/or lobes, observed by one Chinese BeiDou navigation satellite. Such entering electrons can make a possible contribution to the generation of magnetospheric energetic electrons.",

      "abstract": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) play an important role in space weather. The propagation characteristics of CMEs in the Corona and interplanetary space determine whether, when and how the CME will hit the Earth. To this end, a lot of progress has been made both on observational and numerical studies of CMEs. With the development of the advanced observational, theoretical and numerical methods, there emerges more and more research on the morphology, the kinematic evolution, the prediction of the arrival at 1 AU and the acceleration/deceleration processes of CMEs. Moreover, many direct observations and simulations have revealed that the CMEs may not propagate along a straight trajectory both in the corona and interplanetary space. Both observational and numerical studies have shown that, when two or more CMEs collide with each other, their kinematic characteristics may change significantly. Here, we present a review of the recent progress associated with the different aspects of CMEs, including their interplanetary counterparts ICMEs, especially focusing on the initiation of the CME, the CMEs' propagation characteristics, interaction with the background solar wind structures, the deflection of the CMEs, the interaction between successive CMEs, the particle acceleration associated with successive CMEs' interaction, and the effect of compound events on Earth's magnetosphere.",

The reviewed studies are based on modern observations, historical or long-term data including the auroral and cosmogenic radionuclide record, and Kepler observations of Sun-like stars. We compile a table of 100- and 1000-year events based on occurrence frequency distributions for the space weather phenomena listed above. Questions considered include the Sun-like nature of superflare stars and the existence of impactful but unpredictable solar \"black swans\" and extreme \"dragon king\" solar phenomena that can involve different physics from that operating in events which are merely large.",

      "abstract": "In this review we focus on the fundamental theory of magnetohydrodynamic reconnection, together with applications to understanding a wide range of dynamic processes in the solar corona, such as flares, jets, coronal mass ejections, the solar wind and coronal heating. We summarise only briefly the related topics of collisionless reconnection, non-thermal particle acceleration, and reconnection in systems other than the corona. We introduce several preliminary topics that are necessary before the subtleties of reconnection can be fully described: these include null points (Sects. 2.1-2.2), other topological and geometrical features such as separatrices, separators and quasi-separatrix layers (Sects. 2.3, 2.6), the conservation of magnetic flux and field lines (Sect. 3), and magnetic helicity (Sect. 4.6). Formation of current sheets in two- and three-dimensional fields is reviewed in Sect. 5. These set the scene for a discussion of the definition and properties of reconnection in three dimensions that covers the conditions for reconnection, the failure of the concept of a flux velocity, the nature of diffusion, and the differences between two-dimensional and three-dimensional reconnection (Sect. 4). Classical 2D models are briefly presented, including magnetic annihilation (Sect. 6), slow and fast regimes of steady reconnection (Sect. 7), and non-steady reconnection such as the tearing mode (Sect. 8). Then three routes to fast reconnection in a collisional or collisionless medium are described (Sect. 9). The remainder of the review is dedicated to our current understanding of how magnetic reconnection operates in three dimensions and in complex magnetic fields such as that of the Sun's corona. In Sects. 10-12, 14.1 the different regimes of reconnection that are possible in three dimensions are summarised, including at a null point, separator, quasi-separator or a braid. The role of 3D reconnection in solar flares (Sect. 13) is reviewed, as well as in coronal heating (Sect. 14), and the release of the solar wind (Sect. 15.2). Extensions including the role of reconnection in the magnetosphere (Sect. 15.3), the link between reconnection and turbulence (Sect. 16), and the role of reconnection in particle acceleration (Sect. 17) are briefly mentioned.",

      "abstract": "We review the field of collisionless numerical simulations for the large-scale structure of the Universe. We start by providing the main set of equations solved by these simulations and their connection with General Relativity. We then recap the relevant numerical approaches: discretization of the phase-space distribution (focusing on N-body but including alternatives, e.g., Lagrangian submanifold and Schr\u00f6dinger-Poisson) and the respective techniques for their time evolution and force calculation (direct summation, mesh techniques, and hierarchical tree methods). We pay attention to the creation of initial conditions and the connection with Lagrangian Perturbation Theory. We then discuss the possible alternatives in terms of the micro-physical properties of dark matter (e.g., neutralinos, warm dark matter, QCD axions, Bose-Einstein condensates, and primordial black holes), and extensions to account for multiple fluids (baryons and neutrinos), primordial non-Gaussianity and modified gravity. We continue by discussing challenges involved in achieving highly accurate predictions. A key aspect of cosmological simulations is the connection to cosmological observables, we discuss various techniques in this regard: structure finding, galaxy formation and baryonic modelling, the creation of emulators and light-cones, and the role of machine learning. We finalise with a recount of state-of-the-art large-scale simulations and conclude with an outlook for the next decade.",

      "abstract": "The responses of two High-Intensity Long-Duration Continuous AE Activity (HILDCAA) events are investigated using solar wind observations at L1, magnetospheric measurements at geosynchronous orbit, and changes in the global ionosphere. This study provides evidence of the existence of quasi-periodic oscillations (1.5-2 h) in the ionospheric electric field over low latitudes, total electron content at high latitudes, the magnetic field over the globe, energetic electron flux and magnetic field at geosynchronous orbit, geomagnetic indices (SYM-H, AE, and PC) and the Y-component of the interplanetary electric field (IEFy) during the HILDCAA events at all local times. Based on detailed wavelet and cross-spectrum analyses, it is shown that the quasi-periodic oscillation of 1.5-2 h in IEFy is the most effective one that controls the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling process during the HILDCAA events for several days. Therefore, this investigation for the first time, shows that the HILDCAA event affects the global magnetosphere-ionosphere system with a \"quasi-resonant\" mode of oscillation.",

      "abstract": "The preliminary impulse of the sudden commencement is simply explained by the generation of the compressional wave due to sudden compression of the dayside magnetopause and mode conversion from the compressional wave to the Alfv\u00e9n wave in the magnetosphere. However, this simple model cannot explain a time delay of the peak displacement and longer duration time in the higher latitudes in the pre-noon and post-noon sectors of the polar region. Based on the global magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system reveals that this peculiar behavior of the geomagnetic variation of the preliminary impulse is associated with temporal deformation of the ionospheric field-aligned current distribution of the preliminary impulse into a crescent shape; its lower-latitude edge extends toward the anti-sunward direction, and its higher-latitude edge almost stays on the same longitude near noon. Numerical simulations revealed that the deformation of the field-aligned current distribution is derived from different behaviors of the two current systems of the preliminary impulse. The first current system consists of the field-aligned current connected to the field-aligned current of the preliminary impulse in the lower latitude side of the ionosphere, the cross-magnetopause current, and the magnetosheath current (type L current system). The cross-magnetopause current is the inertia current generated in the acceleration front of the solar wind due to the sudden compression of the magnetosheath. Thus, the longitudinal speed of the type L current system in the ionosphere is the solar wind speed in the magnetosheath projected into the ionosphere. In contrast, the current system of the preliminary impulse connected to the field-aligned current of the preliminary impulse at higher latitude (type H current system) consists of the upward/downward field-aligned current in the pre-noon/post-noon sector, respectively, and dawn-to-dusk field-perpendicular current along the dayside magnetopause. The dawn-to-dusk field-perpendicular current moves to the higher latitudes in the outer magnetosphere over time. The field-aligned current of the type H current system is converted from the field-perpendicular current due to convergence of the return field-perpendicular current heading toward the sunward direction in the outer magnetosphere; the return field-perpendicular current is the inertia current driven by the magnetospheric plasma flow associated with compression of the magnetopause behind the front region of the accelerated solar wind. The acceleration front spreads concentrically from the subsolar point. Consequently, as the return field-perpendicular current is converted to the field-aligned current of the type H current system, it does not move much in the longitudinal direction over time because the dawn-to-dusk field-perpendicular current of the type H current system moves to the higher latitudes. Therefore, the high-latitude edge of the current distribution of the preliminary impulse in the ionosphere moves only slightly. Finally, we clarified that the conversion between field-perpendicular current and field-aligned current of the type L current system mainly occurs in the region where the Alfv\u00e9n speed starts to increase toward the Earth. A region with a steep gradient of the Alfv\u00e9n speed like the plasmapause is not always necessary for conversion from the field-perpendicular current to the field-aligned current. We also suggest the possible field-aligned structure of the standing Alfv\u00e9n wave that may occur in the preliminary impulse phase.",

As the analyzed ground-based measurements are basically continuous, the length of individual basis vectors entering into PCA is fundamentally arbitrary. To better characterize both long- and short-period variations, two PCAs with different lengths of the basis vectors are eventually performed. Specifically, either daily frequency-time spectrograms or individual frequency spectra are chosen as the PCA basis vectors. Analysis of the first three principal components shows substantial variations of the wave intensity due to seasonal and local time effects. Intensity variations related to the geomagnetic activity characterized by Kp and AE indices and standard deviation of the magnetic field magnitude are less significant. Moreover, PCA allows one to distinguish between nighttime and daytime Kannuslehto variations and study them independently. Solar and geomagnetic activity effects on the daytime and nighttime measurements are discussed. Wave intensity variations related to substorm occurrence are also analyzed.",

      "abstract": "Wave-particle interactions are fundamental processes in space plasma, and some plasma waves, including electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs), are recognised as broadband noises (BBNs) in the electric field spectral data. Spacecraft observations in recent decades have detected BBNs around the Moon, but the generation mechanism of the BBNs is not fully understood. Here, we study a wake boundary traversal with BBNs observed by Kaguya, which includes an ESW event previously reported by Hashimoto et al. Geophys Res Lett 37:L19204 https://doi.org/10.1029/2010GL044529 (2010). Focusing on the relation between BBNs and electron pitch-angle distribution functions, we show that upward electron beams from the nightside lunar surface are effective for the generation of BBNs, in contrast to the original interpretation by Hashimoto et al. Geophys Res Lett 37:L19204 https://doi.org/10.1029/2010GL044529 (2010) that high-energy electrons accelerated by strong ambipolar electric fields excite ESWs in the region far from the Moon. When the BBNs were observed by the Kaguya spacecraft in the wake boundary, the spacecraft's location was magnetically connected to the nightside lunar surface, and bi-streaming electron distributions of downward-going solar wind strahl component and upward-going field-aligned beams (at \u223c124 eV) were detected. The interplanetary magnetic field was dominated by a positive B<SUB>Z</SUB> (i.e. the northward component), and strahl electrons travelled in the antiparallel direction to the interplanetary magnetic field (i.e. southward), which enabled the strahl electrons to precipitate onto the nightside lunar surface directly. The incident solar wind electrons cause negative charging of the nightside lunar surface, which generates downward electric fields that accelerate electrons from the nightside surface toward higher altitudes along the magnetic field. The bidirectional electron distribution is not a sufficient condition for the BBN generation, and the distribution of upward electron beams seems to be correlated with the BBNs. Ambipolar electric fields in the wake boundary should also contribute to the electron acceleration toward higher altitudes and further intrusion of the solar wind ions into the deeper wake. We suggest that solar wind ion intrusion into the wake boundary is also an important factor that controls the BBN generation by facilitating the influx of solar wind electrons there.",

      "abstract": "Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) plans a Phobos sample return mission (MMX: Martian Moons eXploration). In this study, we review the related works on the past climate of Mars, its evolution, and the present climate and weather to describe the scientific goals and strategies of the MMX mission regarding the evolution of the Martian surface environment. The MMX spacecraft will retrieve and return a sample of Phobos regolith back to Earth in 2029. Mars ejecta are expected to be accumulated on the surface of Phobos without being much shocked. Samples from Phobos probably contain all types of Martian rock from sedimentary to igneous covering all geological eras if ejecta from Mars could be accumulated on the Phobos surface. Therefore, the history of the surface environment of Mars can be restored by analyzing the returned samples. Remote sensing of the Martian atmosphere and monitoring ions escaping to space while the spacecraft is orbiting Mars in the equatorial orbit are also planned. The camera with multi-wavelength filters and the infrared spectrometer onboard the spacecraft can monitor rapid transport processes of water vapor, dust, ice clouds, and other species, which could not be traced by the previous satellites on the sun-synchronous polar orbit. Such time-resolved pictures of the atmospheric phenomena should be an important clue to understand both the processes of water exchange between the surface/underground reservoirs and the atmosphere and the drivers of efficient material transport to the upper atmosphere. The mass spectrometer with unprecedented mass resolution can observe ions escaping to space and monitor the atmospheric escape which has made the past Mars to evolve towards the cold and dry surface environment we know today. Together with the above two instruments, it can potentially reveal what kinds of atmospheric events can transport tracers (e.g., H<SUB>2</SUB>O) upward and enhance the atmospheric escape.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are essential assets for ocean exploration requiring reliable underwater positioning technology. Aiming to improve the latter technology in a low SNR and reverberation environment, the Chan-Taylor hybrid positioning algorithm establishes a long-baseline system (LBL) based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) by reducing the number of sensors required while preserving the positioning accuracy. However, the traditional LBL algorithm's accuracy is reduced due to the critical time delay estimation under such environmental conditions. Hence, this paper suggests a new LBL positioning technology relying on an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to construct a filter function combined with the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation method. MATLAB/Simulink is applied to establish the simulation environment of LBL localization system, simulating the AUV motion under 5-30 dB SNR. This paper analyzes the accuracy of TDOA by generalizing the cross-correlation method (GCC), phase transform (PHAT), ML, and EMD-ML. Based on the TDOA value obtained by the EMD-ML filtering algorithm, the positioning errors of the Chan-Taylor hybrid positioning algorithm and the Chan algorithm are compared. The results show that comparative synthetic evaluations against the traditional GCC demonstrate that the proposed method has a higher time delay estimation accuracy within a reverberation environment with SNR less than 15 dB. The Chan-Taylor hybrid positioning algorithm limits the errors of the CHAN algorithm and improves the overall positioning system accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Galaxies living in rich environments are suffering different perturbations able to drastically affect their evolution. Among these, ram pressure stripping, i.e. the pressure exerted by the hot and dense intracluster medium (ICM) on galaxies moving at high velocity within the cluster gravitational potential well, is a key process able to remove their interstellar medium (ISM) and quench their activity of star formation. This review is aimed at describing this physical mechanism in different environments, from rich clusters of galaxies to loose and compact groups. We summarise the effects of this perturbing process on the baryonic components of galaxies, from the different gas phases (cold atomic and molecular, ionised, hot) to magnetic fields and cosmic rays, and describe their induced effects on the different stellar populations, with a particular attention to its role in the quenching episode generally observed in high-density environments. We also discuss on the possible fate of the stripped material once removed from the perturbed galaxies and mixed with the ICM, and we try to estimate its contribution to the pollution of the surrounding environment. Finally, combining the results of local and high-redshift observations with the prediction of tuned models and simulations, we try to quantify the importance of this process on the evolution of galaxies of different mass, from dwarfs to giants, in various environments and at different epochs.",

      "abstract": "Chatter often occurs in the milling of thin-walled parts due to their high flexibility, which can seriously impair machining accuracy, surface quality, and production efficiency. In this paper, a chatter detection method in the milling of thin-walled parts based on deep learning is proposed. Multi-channel signal features in the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains are employed and their chatter sensitivities are evaluated. A novel temporal attention-based network is constructed. The self-attention mechanism, channel attention mechanism, and attentive statistics pooling are applied to capture the intra-feature correlation, assign the weights of different features, and calculate the variations and weights of features at multiple moments, respectively. The mutual information of distinct features is integrated into the channel attention mechanism to enhance the function of suppressing useless features and enhancing useful ones. The additive angular margin loss function is applied to strengthen intra-class aggregation and inter-class separation. Milling experiments on straight-wall parts are performed, and the classification performance of this model is evaluated in three scenarios. Afterward, milling experiments on curved thin-walled parts are conducted to verify the generalization performance. The results show that the proposed method can accurately detect chatter under varying machining conditions.",

      "abstract": "Theoretical work addressing the role of external pressure with magnetic fields in collapsing molecular clouds is important in building a comprehensive theory of star formation(SF). In many SF studies turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity are described as the key dynamical processes involved in SF. However, the importance of external pressure in collapsing strongly magnetized clouds has not yet been particularly explained. Magnetic fields transport excess angular momentum from the central core while external pressure compresses the cloud. Thus the outflow of angular momentum, and on the other hand, the compression made by external pressure are the cause for matter falling onto the central core from the envelope. Therefore, external pressure facilitates the collapse of gas and the inflow of matter. In this work, we show theoretically how the strong magnetic field is dragged inward by the external pressure during the core collapse and formulate the critical mass of the core in the presence of external pressure.",

      "abstract": "Full spectrum and holospectrum are homogeneous information fusion technology developed for the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, which is extensively exploited in the analysis of the orbits of rotor-bearing systems. However, they are not adapted for non-stationary signals, nor can they be used for fusion analysis of vibrations of multiple bearing sections. By drawing inspiration from the multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) and the complex-valued signal decomposition, we propose a method called multivariate complex variational mode decomposition (MCVMD). It can simultaneously extract the forward and backward components of multiple bearing sections and realize non-stationary complex signal decomposition of multiple bearing sections of the rotor. To achieve the visualization goal of condition monitoring, we propose the three-dimensional instantaneous orbit map (3D-IOM). It enables more features of shaft vibration of a rotor system to be displayed and offers a new way for the fusion analysis of vibration signals of multiple bearing sections of rotating machinery. Furthermore, making the most of the joint information, we also provide a high-resolution time-full spectrum (Time-FS) to display the forward and backward frequency components of multiple bearing sections. The effectiveness of the proposed method through both the simulated experiment and the real-life complex-valued signals is demonstrated in this paper.",

      "abstract": "Plasma and magnetic field observations by BepiColombo during its 2nd Venus flyby in August 10, 2021 have been examined and compared with the newly developed global hybrid simulation LatHyS for the Venusian environment. The LatHyS-Venus simulation was first validated by a comparison with Venus Express observations obtained during average solar wind conditions, before it was applied to the BepiColombo flyby using as inputs solar wind parameters measured upstream of Venus by Solar Orbiter. The simulation confirms that BepiColombo passed through the stagnation region of Venus, which supports the results obtained by data analysis. In addition, we have sampled the plasma parameters along the BepiColombo trajectory and constructed the energy spectrum for two species, i.e., protons of both solar wind and planetary origins, and planetary oxygen ions, and discussed the possible effects due to the limited field of views of the plasma instruments onboard BepiColombo. The most intense observational features are properly captured in the LatHyS-Venus simulation, which show that the model is a powerful tool for interpreting and understanding in-situ data obtained from the instruments with a limited field of views. The estimated ion escape for protons and oxygen ions at Venus during the BepiColombo flyby is of the order of \u223c10<SUP>24</SUP> ions/s, which is the same order of magnitude compared to the estimation from Venus Express observations at the solar minimum.",

      "abstract": "The bearing is one of the most essential parts of rotating machinery and equipment, and the accurate prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of the bearing is of great engineering significance. This paper proposes a novel hybrid prediction architecture called the long short-term memory (LSTM) based on an attention mechanism combined with empirical wavelet transform (EWT) to improve the prediction accuracy of the RUL of bearings. The prediction architecture consists of three parts: firstly, the vibration signal of the bearing is stationarily processed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by EWT decomposition. Then, a novel IMF degradation index based on weighted energy entropy and the variance contribution rate is proposed to select the representative IMFs with more degradation characteristics of the bearing. Finally, the selected IMFs are regarded as inputs for the network model, and the LSTM network model based on the attention mechanism is used to track the degradation state of the bearing and accurately used to predict its remaining life. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the experimental data.",

      "abstract": "Bearing fault diagnosis with extensive labeled fault data has been achieved. In engineering, most machines are in a healthy state. When a fault does occur, the machine is shut down as soon as possible, thus it is difficult and uneconomical to collect enough fault data with labels to carry out a fault diagnosis. To solve the problem, a hybrid fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery, based on variational mode decomposition energy entropy (VMD-EE) and transfer learning (TL), is proposed. First, we decompose the original signal using VMD, calculate the EE value of the modal components, then build a dataset using fault data from these components. Second, a deep residual neural network is proposed to extract high-dimensional features from the dataset and divide the data into source and target domains according to the working conditions. Finally, W-distances are introduced to dynamically evaluate the importance of the conditional and marginal distribution probabilities to minimize the loss, with a feature-based TL method being used to dynamically balance the distribution adaption and reduce the difference in the probability distributions of the two domains. The proposed method is validated using the datasets of Case Western Reserve University and a machinery fault simulator platform. The VMD-based intelligent health detection and statistical analysis solve the problem of mode mixing very well and accurately detect signal faults, or not, by ${\\text{E}}{{\\text{E}}_\\theta }$ , the threshold of VMD-EE. Meanwhile, the accuracy of TL-based neural network fault diagnosis is up to 99.4%, and the losses are kept at around 0.02. These results show the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method in the absence of datasets and under varying operating conditions.",

In order to solve this problem, a prognostic technique with the capability of uncertainty management is proposed in this paper. The implementation of proposed prognostic strategy consists of two phases. In the first phase, the methods of neural network, particle swarm optimization and sample entropy theory are used to construct the interval of the historical degradation and reduce the uncertainty of the constructed interval. In the second phase, the unscented Kalman filter is adopted to obtain the prognostic result. In order to examine the performance of the proposed prognostic method, comparative experiments between different prognostic schemes based on degradation datasets of lithium-ion battery and bearing are performed. The experimental results show that the proposed strategy is an effective prognostic method which can ensure the reliability of the prognostic result.",

In addition to being an interesting system for studying the effect of isovalent substitution on phase/structural evolution in a garnet system, it has direct relevance as an inert matrix for burning minor actinides (MA: Am, Cm, and Np) for reducing the long-term radiotoxicity of nuclear wastes. More importantly, garnet has superior thermal conductivity than the zirconia-based systems which are widely being explored for this application. In order to investigate the phase miscibility and resulting thermophysical behavior, fourteen nominal compositions in Y<SUB>3-x</SUB>Nd<SUB>x</SUB>Al<SUB>5</SUB>O<SUB>12</SUB> (0.0 \u2264 x\u2264 3.0) system (Nd<SUP>3+</SUP>: chosen as the surrogate for MA) were synthesized by gel combustion followed by variable temperature annealing. The atomistic-level mixing ensured high solubility (33 mol% at 1273 K) of Nd<SUP>3+</SUP> in YAG retaining the garnet-phase but the solubility reduced (13 mol%) upon annealing at 1773 K. Raman spectroscopy supported the phase evolution with composition and temperature. The microstructure of select compositions was investigated using SEM/EDS. Nd<SUP>3+</SUP> caused dilation of garnet lattice, increase in average thermal expansion, and lowering of thermal conductivity. It must be emphasized that Nd-doped garnet still possessed better thermal conductivity compared ZrO<SUB>2</SUB>-based systems, a desirable attribute for matrices for MA-transmutation. Other important thermodynamic functions such as molar heat capacity, entropy and molar Gibbs free energy were determined. The study exhibits (a) roles of ionic size, synthesis route, temperature on phase relations upon isovalent substitution in YAG; (b) validation of the thermophysical performance of YAG-type material for MA transmutation.",

      "abstract": "In this study we compare the mean annual sunspot numbers for the six most recent solar cycles (19 to 24) with the number of solar energetic proton events occurring in those years. Though most of the individual cycles exhibit quite strong correlations, when they are combined into a generic solar cycle the result is very significant (\u03c1 = 0.98). For cycles 21 to 24 (when spacecraft observations have been regularly available), we also investigate the variation in the source location of the solar energetic proton events in relation to four peak flux thresholds in orders of magnitude from \u226510 to \u226510,000 pfu. For helio-latitudes within \u00b140\u00b0 (the range within which active regions usually occur) there is negligible variation in the helio-longitude of the source regardless of the peak flux threshold. However, the effect on the helio-longitude of varying the peak flux threshold is very significant: the higher the threshold the closer is the median source longitude to 0\u00b0, the variation being almost uniform from \u226510 pfu (32\u00b0W) to \u226510,000 pfu (2\u00b0W). Finally, of the 10 events in cycles 19 to 24 with peak flux \u226510,000 pfu, all occurred between years 4 and 8 after solar minimum, all were the result of M- or X-class flares with associated halo CMEs and shock fronts, and the three most intense events (\u226540,000 pfu) were all related to X-class flares which occurred in the longitude range 10-28\u00b0E. These results support and extend previous work by the cited authors, and have implications for solar-terrestrial relations and the effects of space weather within geospace.",

      "abstract": "The daily values of the E<SUB>KL</SUB> field and indices of magnetic activity PC, AL and Dst were used to verify stability of relationships between these parameters in course of 23rd and 24th solar cycles. The results of analysis demonstrate that the mean level of correlation between the E<SUB>KL</SUB> field and PC index remains in range R = 0.85-0.90 over 24 years. During the solar maximum epochs (2008, 2015) the correlation between E<SUB>KL</SUB> and PC reduced down to R = 0.75, the decrease being related to solar protons events (SPE), which strongly affect the ionospheric conductivity in polar caps. In the course of both cycles the daily AL index well correlated with PC index (R = 0.93) and with E<SUB>KL</SUB> field (R = 0.83); correlation of daily Dst index with PC and EKL values was much worse (R = 0.72 and 0.64, correspondingly), the correlation being independent of solar activity epochs and cycles. The PC indices in northern (PCN) and southern (PCS) indices hemispheres demonstrate the evident seasonal variation; the PCsummer index is commonly larger than the PCwinter index, but PCwinter index better correlates with E<SUB>KL</SUB> field. The conclusion is made that relationships between the E<SUB>KL</SUB> field, PC index, and the magnetic disturbance indices AL and Dst remained valid in course of 23rd and 24th solar cycles and, therefore, the calibrating coefficients, determining these relationships, are not affected by solar activity.",

We show a possibility to use all the available suite of ground-based instrumentation recording cosmic rays (global network of the neutron monitors located at different locations and altitudes, ground- and underground-based muon telescopes, etc.) for such studies without involving the data from aerologic atmospheric sounding. As a demonstration of the method functionality, we provide the calculation results for the variations in the isotropic flux, pitch angle anisotropy of primary cosmic rays in the interplanetary space, changes in the planetary system of geomagnetic cutoff rigidities for every observational hour, as well as the atmosphere temperature above the point of observation of cosmic ray charged components for selected time intervals.",

We make a survey of various equations of state that can be found in the literature and analyze their effect on the explosion. To simulate the supernovae, we use the general relativistic spherically-symmetric code GR1D, modified to take into account the effects of three-dimensional turbulence through a new mixing length theory approach (STIR). We show that the viability of the explosion is quite EoS dependent and that the strength of explosions correlate best with the central entropy density right after bounce and the onset of turbulent mixing in the proto-neutron star.",

      "abstract": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) play an important role in space weather. The propagation characteristics of CMEs in the Corona and interplanetary space determine whether, when and how the CME will hit the Earth. To this end, a lot of progress has been made both on observational and numerical studies of CMEs. With the development of the advanced observational, theoretical and numerical methods, there emerges more and more research on the morphology, the kinematic evolution, the prediction of the arrival at 1 AU and the acceleration/deceleration processes of CMEs. Moreover, many direct observations and simulations have revealed that the CMEs may not propagate along a straight trajectory both in the corona and interplanetary space. Both observational and numerical studies have shown that, when two or more CMEs collide with each other, their kinematic characteristics may change significantly. Here, we present a review of the recent progress associated with the different aspects of CMEs, including their interplanetary counterparts ICMEs, especially focusing on the initiation of the CME, the CMEs' propagation characteristics, interaction with the background solar wind structures, the deflection of the CMEs, the interaction between successive CMEs, the particle acceleration associated with successive CMEs' interaction, and the effect of compound events on Earth's magnetosphere.",

The prevailing theory suggests that as temperature increases the hydrological cycle is intensified. Practically, this means more and heavier precipitation. However, the exact magnitude of hydrological cycle response and its spatio-temporal characteristics is still under investigation. Looking back in Earth's hydroclimatic history, it is easy to find some periods where global temperature was substantially different than present. Here, we examine some of these periods to present the current knowledge about past hydrological cycle variability (specifically precipitation), and its relationship to temperature. The periods under investigation are the Mid-Miocene Climate Optimum, the Eemian Interglacial Stage, the Last Glacial Maximum, the Heinrich and Dansgaard-Oeschger Events, the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d, the Younger Dryas, the 8.2 ka event, the Medieval Climate Anomaly, and the Little Ice Age.

      "abstract": "Sedimentary structures in ancient deposits are clues to reconstruct past geohazards. While parallel lamination formed by plane beds is one of the most common sedimentary structures in event deposits such as turbidites, the formative conditions for plane beds remain unclear. In the literature, two types of plane beds (upper and lower plane beds) exist and are supposed to develop under different shear stresses, particle sizes, and flow regimes. Here, we present new phase diagrams based on the compilation of existing data regarding formative hydraulic conditions for plane beds to clarify the formation processes associated with the two types of plane beds. The diagrams indicated that the data form two separate populations and the gap between them corresponds to the threshold condition of the particle entrainment into suspension. Lower plane beds form when sediment particles move only as bed load. This phase space can be discerned from fine sand to gravel and differs from the conventional view in which the formation of the lower plane bed is limited to grain sizes above 0.7 mm. In addition, our phase diagrams suggest that upper plane beds appear under conditions of the active suspended load. Our analyses demonstrate that the suspended load contributes to the formation of plane beds, whereas other mechanisms can also produce fine-grained plane beds in flows with low bed shear stress. Thus, the results of this study suggest that the existing interpretations on fine-grained parallel lamination such as Bouma's T<SUB>d</SUB> division need to be reconsidered. The bedform phase diagrams newly established in this study will be useful for estimating the flow conditions from the geologic records of event beds.",

      "abstract": "The release of neodymium (Nd) from particles along continental margins may contribute to losses in the global of Nd budget. The Changjiang River, which carries a heavy load of total suspended matter, empties into the East China Sea, and a strong particulate-seawater interaction process occurs along the salinity gradient. In the low-salinity region (S &lt; 2.0), strong removal of dissolved rare earth elements (dREEs) occurs, but the Nd isotope values are uniform. At mid- and high-salinity (S = 2.0-28.0 and S &gt; 28.0) areas, the dREE concentrations increase slightly. An Nd isotope mass balance indicates that the release of particulate matter is a source of dREEs in the Changjiang estuary. The release rate of particulate Nd (Nd<SUB>SPM</SUB>) to the dissolved Nd pool in Changjiang estuary is higher than other estuaries, such as Amazon estuary. Composite all river data available from the previous studies indicate that 5800-9200 Mg per year of Nd is released to global marine waters from riverine particles. This estimated quantity is on the same order of magnitude as the calculated global Nd release flux based on the case study in the Amazon estuary. Our study indicates that to better constrain the global Nd budget, it is required to consider the release rate of Nd<SUB>SPM</SUB> in different rivers due to the significant difference among various rivers, but with very limited available data as of now.",

      "abstract": "Paleotsunami studies along the Pacific coast of Tohoku, northern Japan, have been considerably developed recently, particularly after the massive impact of the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami. Nevertheless, in the southernmost Shimokita Peninsula, studies pertaining to paleotsunami are underdeveloped, leading to a vague understanding of the tsunamigenic sources northward of the Tohoku region, along with incomplete hazard evaluation. Paleotsunami deposits in Shimokita can be related not only to the Japan Trench along the Sanriku coast but also to the Kuril trench along the Pacific coast of Hokkaido. In this study, we unveiled the paleotsunami history of Hachinohe in northern Tohoku. Using a combination of sedimentological, geochemical, paleontological, and mineralogical proxies, we characterized seven sand layers that dated from ca. 2700 to ca. 5500 yr BP based on radiocarbon (<SUP>14</SUP>C) ages as event deposits of marine origin. Sedimentological and paleontological evidence coupled with ground-penetrating radar imagery revealed a marsh environment comprising successive extinct ponds, controlling the depositional environment. Numerical modeling ruled out the possibility of storms as genetic sources, leading to the conclusion that the presence of event deposits with marine sediments in the study area would be associated with tsunami inundation episodes. Based on <SUP>14</SUP>C dating, the mean frequency of recurrence of tsunamis is estimated as 384 years (320-450 yr, 95% confidence interval) and a coefficient of variation of 0.78 (0.68-0.99, 95% confidence interval). The previously recorded limited paleotsunami evidence and absence of an estimated recurrence interval in the Shimokita Peninsula reaffirm the importance of Hachinohe as a tsunami record site for the activity of both trenches.",

      "abstract": "We have determined rare-earth element (REE) abundances in oldhamites (CaS) from 13 unequilibrated and equilibrated enstatite chondrites (5 EH and 8 EL) and in a few enstatites by in situ, laser ablation ICP-MS. In EH chondrites, oldhamite REE patterns vary from the most primitive petrographic types (EH3) to the most metamorphosed types (EH5). In EH3, CI-normalized REE patterns are convex downward with strong positive Eu and Yb anomalies, whereas EH5 display flat patterns with enrichments reaching about 80 times CI abundances. The positive anomalies of Eu and Yb found in oldhamites of primitive EH chondrites indicate that they represent the condensation of a residual gas fraction, in a manner similar to fine-grained CAIs of carbonaceous chondrites. The early condensate may have been preserved in the matrix of unequilibrated EH. Equilibrated EH oldhamite patterns may result from metamorphic evolution and REE redistribution on the EH parent body. On the contrary, all the oldhamites from EL chondrites (EL3 to EL6) display a single kind of patterns, which is convex upward and is about 100 times enriched relative to CI, with a negative Eu anomaly. In addition, the EL pattern is similar to that of oldhamites from aubrites (enstatite achondrites). The latter observation suggests that oldhamites of all EL metamorphic types (including primitive ones) bear the signature of a magmatic event accompanied by FeS loss as vapor, prior to the assembly of the EL parent body. Given the difficulty of obtaining precise ages on enstatite chondrites, it is not possible to discuss the chronology of the events recorded by the oldhamite REE patterns.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a new numerical model developed to assist with Data Interpretation and Numerical Analysis of ionospheric Missions and Observations (DINAMO). DINAMO derives the ionospheric electrostatic potential at low- and mid-latitudes from a two-dimensional dynamo equation and user-specified inputs for the state of the ionosphere and thermosphere (I-T) system. The potential is used to specify the electric fields and associated F-region E \u00d7 B plasma drifts. Most of the model was written in Python to facilitate the setup of numerical experiments and to engage students in numerical modeling applied to space sciences. Here, we illustrate applications and results of DINAMO in two different analyses. First, DINAMO is used to assess the ability of widely used I-T climatological models (IRI-2016, NRLMSISE-00, and HWM14), when used as drivers, to produce a realistic representation of the low-latitude electrodynamics. In order to evaluate the results, model E \u00d7 B drifts are compared with observed climatology of the drifts derived from long-term observations made by the Jicamarca incoherent scatter radar. We found that the climatological I-T models are able to drive many of the features of the plasma drifts including the diurnal, seasonal, altitudinal and solar cycle variability. We also identified discrepancies between modeled and observed drifts under certain conditions. This is, in particular, the case of vertical equatorial plasma drifts during low solar flux conditions, which were attributed to a poor specification of the E-region neutral wind dynamo. DINAMO is then used to quantify the impact of meridional currents on the morphology of F-region zonal plasma drifts. Analytic representations of the equatorial drifts are commonly used to interpret observations. These representations, however, commonly ignore contributions from meridional currents. Using DINAMO we show that that these currents can modify zonal plasma drifts by up to ~ 16 m/s in the bottom-side post-sunset F-region, and up to ~ 10 m/s between 0700 and 1000 LT for altitudes above 500 km. Finally, DINAMO results show the relationship between the pre-reversal enhancement (PRE) of the vertical drifts and the vertical shear in the zonal plasma drifts with implications for equatorial spread F.",

      "abstract": "Marine isotope stage (MIS) 19 is considered to be the best orbital analog for the present interglacial. Consequently, clarifying the climatic features of this period can provide us with insights regarding a natural baseline for assessing future climate changes. A high-resolution radiolarian record from 800 to 750 ka (MIS 20 to MIS 18) was examined from the Chiba composite section (CbCS) of the Kokumoto Formation, including the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point for the lower-middle Pleistocene boundary on the Boso Peninsula on the Pacific side of central Japan. Millennial-scale oscillations in the Kuroshio warm and Oyashio cold currents were revealed by the Tr index, which is estimated using a simple equation based on radiolarian assemblages. The estimated Tr values ranged between 0.1 and 0.8 for MIS 18 through MIS 19, with minimum and maximum values corresponding to values observed off present day Aomori (41\u00b0N) and the Boso Peninsula (35\u00b0N), respectively. The observed patterns tended to be synchronous with the total radiolarian abundance associated with their production. Multiple maxima in radiolarian abundance occurred during periods of the Oyashio expanded mode before 785 ka and during periods of Kuroshio extension after 785 ka in MIS 19. Such increases in radiolarian abundance with the Kuroshio extension during MIS 19 are likely related to improvements in nutrient and photic environments with the development of a two-layer structure along the Kuroshio-Oyashio boundary zone. A similar pattern of millennial-scale climatic changes was also recognized in a precipitation record from the Sulmona Basin in central Italy, suggesting a close relationship with the CbCS record as a result of a large-scale climate system similar to the Arctic Oscillation in the northern hemisphere.",

It heats the atmosphere, enhances the atmospheric general circulation, and affects spacecraft instruments and operations. Compliant with that, studying dust is also essential for future human exploration. In this work, we present a method for the deep-learning-based detection of the areal extent of dust storms in Mars satellite imagery. We use a mask regional convolutional neural network, consisting of a regional-proposal network and a mask network. We apply the detection method to Mars daily global maps of the Mars global surveyor, Mars orbiter camera. We use center coordinates of dust storms from the eight-year Mars dust activity database as ground-truth to train and validate the method. The performance of the regional network is evaluated by the average precision score with 50 % overlap (m A P<SUB>50</SUB> ), which is around 62.1 %.",

      "abstract": "We estimated the time difference between the 1854 CE Ansei-Tokai and Ansei-Nankai earthquakes from tidal records of two tide gauge stations (San Francisco and San Diego) on the west coast of North America. The first signals of the Ansei-Tokai tsunami were apparent, whereas those of the Ansei-Nankai tsunami were obscured by the later waves of the Ansei-Tokai tsunami. Waveforms of the Ansei-Nankai tsunami simulated with nonlinear dispersive wave theory by assuming an origin time of 07:00 GMT on 24 December arrived earlier than in the observations. The normalized root mean square and the misfit between the simulated and observed waveforms of the Ansei-Nankai tsunami showed a time difference between them of approximately 0.4 h. This finding suggests that the actual origin time of the Ansei-Nankai tsunami was approximately 07:24 GMT on 24 December. A previous study estimated the origin time of the Ansei-Tokai tsunami to be about 00:30 GMT on 23 December. Thus, we concluded that the time difference between the 1854 CE Ansei-Tokai and Ansei-Nankai tsunamis was 30.9 h. Despite the significant difference in the time resolution between the seasonal timekeeping system used in Japan in 1854 and waveform digitization, our result is roughly in agreement with historical descriptions of the tsunamis, suggesting that such information can be effectively used to determine the origin times of historical earthquakes.",

      "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed a rapid growth of graphene plasmonics and their applications in different fields. Compared with conventional plasmonic materials, graphene enables highly confined plasmons with much longer lifetimes. Moreover, graphene plasmons work in an extended wavelength range, i.e., mid-infrared and terahertz regime, overlapping with the fingerprints of most organic and biomolecules, and have broadened their applications towards plasmonic biological and chemical sensors. In this review, we discuss intrinsic plasmonic properties of graphene and strategies both for tuning graphene plasmons as well as achieving higher performance by integrating graphene with plasmonic nanostructures. Next, we survey applications of graphene and graphene-hybrid materials in biosensors, chemical sensors, optical sensors, and sensors in other fields. Lastly, we conclude this review by providing a brief outlook and challenges of the field. Through this review, we aim to provide an overall picture of graphene plasmonic sensing and to suggest future trends of development of graphene plasmonics.",

      "abstract": "In the last decade, carbon quantum dots (CQDs), as a novel class of carbon-based nanomaterials, have received increasing attention due to their distinct properties. CQDs are ultimately small nanoparticles with an average size below 10 nm, possessing high water solubility, alluring photoluminescence, photostability, excellent biocompatibility, low/none toxicity, environmental friendliness, and high sustainability, etc. In history, there are intermittent threats from viruses to humans, animals and plants worldwide, resulting in enormous crises and impacts on our life, environment, economy and society. Some recent studies have unveiled that certain types of CQDs exhibited high and potent antiviral activities against various viruses such as human coronavirus, arterivirus, norovirus and herpesvirus. Moreover, they have been successfully explored and developed for different virus detections including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This article exclusively overviews and discusses the recent progress of designing, synthesizing, modifying/functionalizing and developing CQDs towards effective virus detection as well as the inhibition and treatment of viral infection. Their mechanisms and applications against various pathogenic viruses are addressed. The latest outcomes for combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) utilizing CQDs are also highlighted. It can be envisaged that CQDs could further benefit the development of virus detectors and antiviral agents with added broad-spectrum activity and cost-effective production.",

Challenges faced during real condition in-operando test of newly developed OFETs originated an idea of creation of a new setup which excludes number of factors that make experiments complicated. The application of the setup is demonstrated on a prototype of an organic transistors based on \u03b1,\u03c9-dihexyl-\u03b1-quaterthiophene molecules. The new setup allows to monitor material structural changes by X-ray scattering under applied voltage conditions and their direct correlations. The versatile setup eliminates possible shadowing effects and short circuits due to misalignment of the contacts. The electrical stability of the prototypes was characterized by the application of different voltage values. Corresponding structural changes were monitored by grazing X-ray scattering technique before, during and after the voltage was applied. The selected oligothiophene material with proved transistor properties shows high stability and directional anisotropy under applied voltage conditions. Thanks to a compact and flexible design of the setup, different type of small dimension devices could be studied under external voltage conditions at various synchrotron beamlines.",

      "abstract": "Developing techniques to effectively and real-time monitor and regulate the interior environment of biological objects is significantly important for many biomedical engineering and scientific applications, including drug delivery, electrophysiological recording and regulation of intracellular activities. Semi-implantable bioelectronics is currently a hot spot in biomedical engineering research area, because it not only meets the increasing technical demands for precise detection or regulation of biological activities, but also provides a desirable platform for externally incorporating complex functionalities and electronic integration. Although there is less definition and summary to distinguish it from the well-reviewed non-invasive bioelectronics and fully implantable bioelectronics, semi-implantable bioelectronics have emerged as highly unique technology to boost the development of biochips and smart wearable device. Here, we reviewed the recent progress in this field and raised the concept of \"Semi-implantable bioelectronics\", summarizing the principle and strategies of semi-implantable device for cell applications and in vivo applications, discussing the typical methodologies to access to intracellular environment or in vivo environment, biosafety aspects and typical applications. This review is meaningful for understanding in-depth the design principles, materials fabrication techniques, device integration processes, cell/tissue penetration methodologies, biosafety aspects, and applications strategies that are essential to the development of future minimally invasive bioelectronics.",

      "abstract": "Natural enzymes usually suffer from high production cost, ease of denaturation and inactivation, and low yield, making them difficult to be broadly applicable. As an emerging type of artificial enzyme, nanozymes that combine the characteristics of nanomaterials and enzymes are promising alternatives. On the one hand, nanozymes have high enzyme-like catalytic activities to regulate biochemical reactions. On the other hand, nanozymes also inherit the properties of nanomaterials, which can ameliorate the shortcomings of natural enzymes and serve as versatile platforms for diverse applications. In this review, various nanozymes that mimic the catalytic activity of different enzymes are introduced. The achievements of nanozymes in different cancer diagnosis and treatment technologies are summarized by highlighting the advantages of nanozymes in these applications. Finally, future research directions in this rapidly developing field are outlooked.[inline-graphic not available: see fulltext]",

      "abstract": "Red blood cells (RBCs) have recently emerged as promosing candidates for cancer treatment in terms of relieving tumor hypoxia and inducing oxidative damage against cancer cells, but they are still far from satisfactory due to their limited oxygen transport and reactive oxygen species generation rate in tumor tissue. Herein, artificial RBCs (designated FTP@RBCM) with radical storm production ability were developed for oncotherapy through multidimensional reactivity pathways of Fe-protoporphyrin-based hybrid metal-organic frameworks (FTPs, as the core), including photodynamic/chemodynamic-like, catalase-like and glutathione peroxidase-like activities. Meanwhile, owing to the advantages of long circulation abilities of RBCs provided by their cell membranes (RBCMs), FTP with a surface coated with RBCMs (FTP@RBCM) could enormously accumulate at tumor site to achieve remarkably enhanced therapeutic efficiency. Intriguingly, this ROS-mediated dynamic therapy was demonstrated to induce acute local inflammation and high immunogenic cancer death, which evoked a systemic antitumor immune response when combined with the newly identified T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-containing molecule 3 (Tim-3) checkpoint blockade, leading to not only effective elimination of primary tumors but also an abscopal effect of growth suppression of distant tumors. Therefore, such RBC-mimic nanocatalysts with multidimensional catalytic capacities might provide a promising new insight into synergistic cancer treatment.",

Nanotechnology-enabled vaccines have been positioned as solutions to mitigate the pandemic outbreak caused by the novel pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. To fast-track the development of vaccines, unprecedented industrial and academic collaborations emerged around the world, resulting in the clinical translation of effective vaccines in less than one year. In this article, we provide an overview of the path to translation from the bench to the clinic of nanotechnology-enabled messenger ribonucleic acid vaccines and examine in detail the types of delivery systems used, their mechanisms of action, obtained results during each phase of their clinical development and their regulatory approval process. We also analyze how nanotechnology is impacting global health and economy during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.",

They have been implicated in many diseases including cancer and neurodegeneration. EVs are detected in all bodily fluids, and their protein and nucleic acid content offers a means of assessing the status of the cells from which they originated. As such, they provide opportunities in biomarker discovery for diagnosis, prognosis or the stratification of diseases as well as an objective monitoring of therapies. The simultaneous assaying of multiple EV-derived markers will be required for an impactful practical application, and multiplexing platforms have evolved with the potential to achieve this. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of the currently available multiplexing platforms for EV analysis, with a primary focus on miniaturized and integrated devices that offer potential step changes in analytical power, throughput and consistency.",

      "abstract": "We trace the evolution of research on extreme solar and solar-terrestrial events from the 1859 Carrington event to the rapid development of the last twenty years. Our focus is on the largest observed/inferred/theoretical cases of sunspot groups, flares on the Sun and Sun-like stars, coronal mass ejections, solar proton events, and geomagnetic storms. The reviewed studies are based on modern observations, historical or long-term data including the auroral and cosmogenic radionuclide record, and Kepler observations of Sun-like stars. We compile a table of 100- and 1000-year events based on occurrence frequency distributions for the space weather phenomena listed above. Questions considered include the Sun-like nature of superflare stars and the existence of impactful but unpredictable solar \"black swans\" and extreme \"dragon king\" solar phenomena that can involve different physics from that operating in events which are merely large.",

      "abstract": "In this review we focus on the fundamental theory of magnetohydrodynamic reconnection, together with applications to understanding a wide range of dynamic processes in the solar corona, such as flares, jets, coronal mass ejections, the solar wind and coronal heating. We summarise only briefly the related topics of collisionless reconnection, non-thermal particle acceleration, and reconnection in systems other than the corona. We introduce several preliminary topics that are necessary before the subtleties of reconnection can be fully described: these include null points (Sects. 2.1-2.2), other topological and geometrical features such as separatrices, separators and quasi-separatrix layers (Sects. 2.3, 2.6), the conservation of magnetic flux and field lines (Sect. 3), and magnetic helicity (Sect. 4.6). Formation of current sheets in two- and three-dimensional fields is reviewed in Sect. 5. These set the scene for a discussion of the definition and properties of reconnection in three dimensions that covers the conditions for reconnection, the failure of the concept of a flux velocity, the nature of diffusion, and the differences between two-dimensional and three-dimensional reconnection (Sect. 4). Classical 2D models are briefly presented, including magnetic annihilation (Sect. 6), slow and fast regimes of steady reconnection (Sect. 7), and non-steady reconnection such as the tearing mode (Sect. 8). Then three routes to fast reconnection in a collisional or collisionless medium are described (Sect. 9). The remainder of the review is dedicated to our current understanding of how magnetic reconnection operates in three dimensions and in complex magnetic fields such as that of the Sun's corona. In Sects. 10-12, 14.1 the different regimes of reconnection that are possible in three dimensions are summarised, including at a null point, separator, quasi-separator or a braid. The role of 3D reconnection in solar flares (Sect. 13) is reviewed, as well as in coronal heating (Sect. 14), and the release of the solar wind (Sect. 15.2). Extensions including the role of reconnection in the magnetosphere (Sect. 15.3), the link between reconnection and turbulence (Sect. 16), and the role of reconnection in particle acceleration (Sect. 17) are briefly mentioned.",

      "abstract": "Observation of auroras at low latitudes is an extremely rare event typically associated with major magnetic storms due to intense Earth-directed Coronal Mass Ejections. Since these energetic events represent one of the most important components of space weather, their study is of paramount importance to understand the Sun-Earth connection. Due to the rarity of these events, being able to access all available information for the few cases studied is equally important. Especially if we refer to historical periods in which current accurate observations from ground-based instruments or space were not available. Certainly, among these events, we must include the great aurora of February 4, 1872. An event whose effects have been observed in different regions of the Earth. What we could consider today a global event, especially for its effects on the communication systems of the time, such as the transatlantic cable that allowed a connection between the United States and Europe since 1866. In this paper, we describe the main results of the observations and studies carried out by Angelo Secchi at the Observatory of the Roman College and described in his Memoria sull'Aurora Elettrica del 4 Febbraio 1872 for the Notes of the Pontifical Academy of new Lincei. This note is extremely modern both in its multi-instrumental approach to the study of these phenomena and in its association between solar-terrestrial connection and technological infrastructures on the Earth. The Secchi's note definitely represents the first example of analysis and study of an event on a global scale, such as the Atlantic cable, affecting the Earth. What we nowadays call an extreme space weather event.",

      "abstract": "Heavy rainfall brought by typhoons has been recognised as a major trigger of landslides in Taiwan. On average, 3.75 typhoons strike the island every year, and cause large amounts of shallow landslides and debris flow in mountainous region. Because landslide occurrence strongly corresponds to the storm dynamics, a reliable typhoon forecast is therefore essential to landslide hazard management in Taiwan. Given early warnings with sufficient lead time, rainfall-induced shallow landslide forecasting can help people prepare disaster prevention measures. To account for inherent weather uncertainties, this study adopted an ensemble forecasting model for executing precipitation forecasts, instead of using a single-model output. A shallow landslide prediction model based on the infinite slope model and TOPMODEL was developed. Considering the detailed topographic characteristics of a catchment, the proposed model can estimate the change in saturated water table during rainstorms and then link with the slope-instability analysis to clarify whether shallow landslides can occur in the catchment.",

      "abstract": "Water quality is the restrictive factor for both ecosystem health and social development in the Chinese Loess Plateau, a unique area with most severe soil erosion, fragile ecology, and water shortage. Understanding the characteristics of the pollutant loads is of vital importance for the sustainability of eco-environment in the Loess Plateau. This study investigated the spatiotemporal changes of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) loads by combining the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and regression model Load Estimator (LOADEST) in a typical loess hilly and gully watershed\u2014the Yan River Basin (YanRB). Results showed that the model simulations of monthly streamflow and pollutant loads were in good agreement with those derived from the in situ observations. The temporal variation analysis suggested that the pollutant loads were generally rising in the study period (2001-2018) at four of the five stations and reached the maximum in 2014, and the multi-year (i.e., 2001-2018 with 2013 being excluded due to extreme rainfall) average loads of COD, TN, and TP at the Tanjiahe station, which is close to the outlet of the basin, were 15,021 kg/day, 3835 kg/day, and 168 kg/day, respectively. The spatial distribution of the TN and TP loads along the river seemed to be quite unique because the TP level were obviously higher at the midstream (e.g., Zhujiagou and Ganguyi) than the downstream (e.g., Tanjiahe), and the TN level decreased when the river flowed from Zhujiagou to Ganguyi. Further, the seasonal analysis indicated that the nutrient loads were the highest in summer, followed by autumn, and the loads in these two seasons contributed the most of the annual pollution loads\u2014about 76% and 84% for TN and TP, respectively, indicating the higher flow, the higher pollution load, a similar point based on the inter-annual analysis. In addition, the contribution analysis of point source and non-point source pollutions demonstrated that NPS led to most of the pollutant loads at the whole watershed\u201470%, 67%, and 71% of the COD, TN, and TP loads, respectively. Overall, this study provided spatiotemporal distributions of the key pollutant loads in the YanRB and can be valuable for water quality protection and pollution control in this area.",

      "abstract": "The India-Burma troughs (IBTs) with different shapes (i.e., narrow and wide IBT-like circulations) can significantly affect winter precipitation over different regions in southern China through modulating the paths of water vapor transportation ahead of the IBTs. The effect of the wide/narrow IBT- (WIBT/NIBT-) like circulation cannot be depicted by traditional IBT indices that mainly focus on the IBT's intensity. This study defines the WIBT and NIBT indices, which can effectively distinguish different water vapor transportation in front of the WIBT and NIBT and relevant water vapor convergence and therefore successfully reflect different distributions of winter precipitation anomalies over southern China. Further exploration reveals that a Rossby wave from the Mediterranean Sea to the Bay of Bengal (BoB) contributes to the variability of the NIBT, while the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can modulate the variability of the WIBT by stimulating the Matsuno-Gill response.

      "abstract": "Identification of the sources of the spatio-temporal information of flooding is important for flood control and understanding the water dynamic. Flood disasters are generally caused by two main sources: fluvial and pluvial flooding. However, there is a gap in information and challenge of such particular information in the Mekong River Basin (MRB) known as the largest river basin in Southeast Asia. This paper aims to analyze the spatio-temporal hydrograph separations of flooding and to determine the fluvial and pluvial sources of inundation water in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) by using a distributed rainfall-runoff-inundation (RRI) model and time-space accounting scheme (T-SAS) method. This study focuses on the two major flood events in 2000 and 2011, whose characteristics were different. The one in 2000 was long in terms of flood duration and it was the historically largest annual total flood water with twice the peak times in July and September. The 2011 flood had the highest flooded water during the peak time; however, its annual total flood water was less than the one in 2000. The results of spatio-temporal sources of flooding indicated that during the flow peak time in 2000 and 2011, the flow at Kratie was mainly contributed by 30-day (67%) and 100-day (98%) precipitation from the upstream. The drainage area of the MRB in China, northern Lao PDR, southern Lao PDR and eastern Thailand, and Cambodia and Vietnam contributed to peak flood at Kratie by 13%, 27%, 33%, and 27% for the 2000 flood and 12%, 33%, 38%, and 16% for the 2011 flood. The source of inundated water in the LMB was derived from upstream flow (fluvial source) of 35-36% and local rainfall (pluvial source) of 64-65%. Even though flood events in 2000 and 2011 had different characteristics, the sources of flood inundation in the LMB for both events were majorly from the local rainfall rather than the upstream flow. The large annual flood volume and long during of flooding in 2000 caused severe total economic damages up to 517 million US$ in the LMB countries (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Vietnam), while the high peak inundated water in 2011 with shorter flood duration caused damages of 493 million US$.",

Interplanetary energetic electrons, mainly consisting of continuous solar wind superhalo electrons and transient solar energetic electron events both with typical power-law energy spectra, can provide a source of energetic electrons to the Earth's magnetosphere. After briefly summarizing recent results of solar wind superhalo electrons and solar energetic electron events, this paper reviews the first evidences for the direct and continuous entry of energetic electrons from the interplanetary medium to the Earth's polar cusp, cap and/or lobes, observed by one Chinese BeiDou navigation satellite. Such entering electrons can make a possible contribution to the generation of magnetospheric energetic electrons.",

      "abstract": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) play an important role in space weather. The propagation characteristics of CMEs in the Corona and interplanetary space determine whether, when and how the CME will hit the Earth. To this end, a lot of progress has been made both on observational and numerical studies of CMEs. With the development of the advanced observational, theoretical and numerical methods, there emerges more and more research on the morphology, the kinematic evolution, the prediction of the arrival at 1 AU and the acceleration/deceleration processes of CMEs. Moreover, many direct observations and simulations have revealed that the CMEs may not propagate along a straight trajectory both in the corona and interplanetary space. Both observational and numerical studies have shown that, when two or more CMEs collide with each other, their kinematic characteristics may change significantly. Here, we present a review of the recent progress associated with the different aspects of CMEs, including their interplanetary counterparts ICMEs, especially focusing on the initiation of the CME, the CMEs' propagation characteristics, interaction with the background solar wind structures, the deflection of the CMEs, the interaction between successive CMEs, the particle acceleration associated with successive CMEs' interaction, and the effect of compound events on Earth's magnetosphere.",

Owing to its excellent energy-exchange mechanism, the WPI has gained increasing interest not only from theoretical points of view, but also its many important applications including plasma heating and plasma acceleration. In this review work, we present theoretical backgrounds of linear and nonlinear wave-particle interactions in quantum plasmas. Specifically, we focus on the wave-particle interactions for homogeneous plasma waves (i.e., waves with infinite extent rather than a localized pulse) as well as for propagating electrostatic waves in the weak and strong quantum regimes to demonstrate the modifications of several classical features including those associated with resonant and trapped particles. Finally, the future perspectives of WPI in quantum plasmas are presented.",

However, a precise understanding of the definitive relationship between the configuration of metal single atoms and the dielectric loss properties of M-N<SUB>x</SUB>Cs at the atomic-level is still lacking. Herein, we report a general approach to synthesize a series of three-dimensional (3D) honeycomb-like M-N<SUB>x</SUB>C (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, or Ni) containing metal single atoms. Experimental results indicate that 3D M-N<SUB>x</SUB>Cs exhibit a greatly enhanced dielectric loss compared with that of the NC matrix. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the density of states of the d orbitals near the Fermi level is significantly increased and additional electrical dipoles are induced due to the destruction of the symmetry of the local microstructure, which enhances conductive loss and dipolar polarization loss of 3D M-N<SUB>x</SUB>Cs, respectively. Consequently, these 3D M-N<SUB>x</SUB>Cs exhibit excellent electromagnetic wave absorption properties, outperforming the most commonly reported absorbers. This study systematically explains the mechanism of dielectric loss at the atomic level for the first time and is of significance to the rational design of high-efficiency electromagnetic wave absorbing materials containing metal single atoms.",

Our focus is on the largest observed/inferred/theoretical cases of sunspot groups, flares on the Sun and Sun-like stars, coronal mass ejections, solar proton events, and geomagnetic storms. The reviewed studies are based on modern observations, historical or long-term data including the auroral and cosmogenic radionuclide record, and Kepler observations of Sun-like stars. We compile a table of 100- and 1000-year events based on occurrence frequency distributions for the space weather phenomena listed above. Questions considered include the Sun-like nature of superflare stars and the existence of impactful but unpredictable solar \"black swans\" and extreme \"dragon king\" solar phenomena that can involve different physics from that operating in events which are merely large.",

      "abstract": "In this review we focus on the fundamental theory of magnetohydrodynamic reconnection, together with applications to understanding a wide range of dynamic processes in the solar corona, such as flares, jets, coronal mass ejections, the solar wind and coronal heating. We summarise only briefly the related topics of collisionless reconnection, non-thermal particle acceleration, and reconnection in systems other than the corona. We introduce several preliminary topics that are necessary before the subtleties of reconnection can be fully described: these include null points (Sects. 2.1-2.2), other topological and geometrical features such as separatrices, separators and quasi-separatrix layers (Sects. 2.3, 2.6), the conservation of magnetic flux and field lines (Sect. 3), and magnetic helicity (Sect. 4.6). Formation of current sheets in two- and three-dimensional fields is reviewed in Sect. 5. These set the scene for a discussion of the definition and properties of reconnection in three dimensions that covers the conditions for reconnection, the failure of the concept of a flux velocity, the nature of diffusion, and the differences between two-dimensional and three-dimensional reconnection (Sect. 4). Classical 2D models are briefly presented, including magnetic annihilation (Sect. 6), slow and fast regimes of steady reconnection (Sect. 7), and non-steady reconnection such as the tearing mode (Sect. 8). Then three routes to fast reconnection in a collisional or collisionless medium are described (Sect. 9). The remainder of the review is dedicated to our current understanding of how magnetic reconnection operates in three dimensions and in complex magnetic fields such as that of the Sun's corona. In Sects. 10-12, 14.1 the different regimes of reconnection that are possible in three dimensions are summarised, including at a null point, separator, quasi-separator or a braid. The role of 3D reconnection in solar flares (Sect. 13) is reviewed, as well as in coronal heating (Sect. 14), and the release of the solar wind (Sect. 15.2). Extensions including the role of reconnection in the magnetosphere (Sect. 15.3), the link between reconnection and turbulence (Sect. 16), and the role of reconnection in particle acceleration (Sect. 17) are briefly mentioned.",

      "abstract": "We review the field of collisionless numerical simulations for the large-scale structure of the Universe. We start by providing the main set of equations solved by these simulations and their connection with General Relativity. We then recap the relevant numerical approaches: discretization of the phase-space distribution (focusing on N-body but including alternatives, e.g., Lagrangian submanifold and Schr\u00f6dinger-Poisson) and the respective techniques for their time evolution and force calculation (direct summation, mesh techniques, and hierarchical tree methods). We pay attention to the creation of initial conditions and the connection with Lagrangian Perturbation Theory. We then discuss the possible alternatives in terms of the micro-physical properties of dark matter (e.g., neutralinos, warm dark matter, QCD axions, Bose-Einstein condensates, and primordial black holes), and extensions to account for multiple fluids (baryons and neutrinos), primordial non-Gaussianity and modified gravity. We continue by discussing challenges involved in achieving highly accurate predictions. A key aspect of cosmological simulations is the connection to cosmological observables, we discuss various techniques in this regard: structure finding, galaxy formation and baryonic modelling, the creation of emulators and light-cones, and the role of machine learning. We finalise with a recount of state-of-the-art large-scale simulations and conclude with an outlook for the next decade.",

      "abstract": "The concept of electron acceleration by a laser beam in vacuum is attractive due to its seeming simplicity, but its implementation has been elusive, as it requires efficient electron injection into the beam and a mechanism for counteracting transverse expulsion. Electron injection during laser reflection off a plasma mirror is a promising mechanism, but it is sensitive to the plasma density gradient that is hard to control. We get around this sensitivity by utilizing volumetric injection that takes place when a helical laser beam traverses a low-density target. The electron retention is achieved by choosing the helicity, such that the transverse field profiles are hollow while the longitudinal fields are peaked on central axis. We demonstrate using three-dimensional simulations that a 3 PW helical laser can generate a 50 pC low-divergence electron beam with a maximum energy of 1.5 GeV. The unique features of the beam are short acceleration distance (\u223c100 \u03bcm), compact transverse size, high areal density, and electron bunching (\u223c100 as bunch duration).",

      "abstract": "Generation of energetic electron-positron pairs using multi-petawatt (PW) lasers has recently attracted increasing interest. However, some previous laser-driven positron beams have severe limitations in terms of energy spread, beam duration, density, and collimation. Here we propose a scheme for the generation of dense ultra-short quasi-monoenergetic positron bunches by colliding a twisted laser pulse with a Gaussian laser pulse. In this scheme, abundant \u03b3-photons are first generated via nonlinear Compton scattering and positrons are subsequently generated during the head-on collision of \u03b3-photons with the Gaussian laser pulse. Due to the unique structure of the twisted laser pulse, the positrons are confined by the radial electric fields and experience phase-locked-acceleration by the longitudinal electric field. Three-dimensional simulations demonstrate the generation of dense sub-femtosecond quasi-monoenergetic GeV positron bunches with tens of picocoulomb (pC) charge and extremely high brilliance above 10<SUP>14</SUP> s<SUP>\u22121</SUP> mm<SUP>\u22122</SUP> mrad<SUP>\u22122</SUP> eV<SUP>\u22121</SUP>, making them promising for applications in laboratory physics and high energy physics.",

      "abstract": "This article investigates the correlation between the Kappa and L\u00e9vy distributions via two approaches of the Klein-Kramers equation. The first approach illustrates the velocity distribution functions via the solution of the fractional Klein-Kramers equation obtained using the Riesz fractional derivative. In contrast, the second approach shows the velocity distribution functions according to steady-state Kappa distribution, which arises from the solution of the Klein-Kramers equation with variable coefficients dependent on velocity. We find a unique and straightforward formula representing the relation between the Kappa exponent and the fractality index (L\u00e9vy stable index). The results indicate a viable probability distribution obtained from the fractional equations as an alternative to the Kappa distribution. Hence, our results may shed light on the stationary power-law distribution in non extensive statistics and introduce a new correlation between the order of the fractional derivative (\u03b1) and the nonthermal index (\u03ba) of the distribution function. Our results also show exact matching with the probability distributions illustrated in the literature.",

      "abstract": "We propose a meshless method to compute pressure fields from image velocimetry data, regardless of whether this is available on a regular grid as in cross-correlation based velocimetry or on scattered points as in tracking velocimetry. The proposed approach is based on radial basis functions (RBFs) regression and relies on the solution of two constrained least square problems. The first one is the regression of the measurements to create an analytic representation of the velocity field. This regression can be constrained to impose boundary conditions (e.g. no-slip velocity on a wall or inlet conditions) or differential constraints (e.g. the solenoidal condition for an incompressible flow). The second one is the meshless integration of the pressure Poisson equation, achieved by seeking a solution in the form of a RBF expansion and using constraints to impose boundary conditions. We first illustrate the derivation of the two least square problems and the numerical techniques implemented for their solution. Then, we showcase the method with three numerical test cases of growing complexity. These are a 2D Gaussian Vortex, a 2D flow past a cylinder from CFD and a 3D Stokes flow past a sphere. For each case, we consider randomly sampled vector fields simulating particle tracking measurements and analyze the sensitivity to noise and seeding density.",

      "abstract": "Top Shaped Asteroids (TSAs) have proven to be common amongst the near-Earth rubble pile population, with multiple examples confirmed via groundbased radar and spaceborne optical sensors through the past 20 years. A substantial body of literature has developed, exploring the formation of these unique shapes either through rotation-induced landslides and creep, or collisional reaccumulation. Models of such mass movements can provide good explanations for mid and low latitude material redistribution, but Bennu also shows a significant increase in radius in the high polar regions, which is harder to explain with these processes. The discovery of repeated and probably ongoing particle ejections around the 500 m diameter asteroid Bennu by the OSIRIS-REx mission suggests that we need to consider an alternate or additional mechanism which, we show, can anticipate the detailed variety of TSA shapes. This paper explores asteroid shape evolution as the result of particle ejections, modeled as being simply correlated with latitude via diurnal heating (or meteorite impacts), and re-accumulation using simulations including gravity and solar radiation pressure. Asteroid outlines are evolved with time as a function of particle ejection velocities and asteroid rotation rates. Bennu's shape can be anticipated by our model with RMS surface errors of less than 1.1% (2.7 m) although some southern latitudes have errors up to 10 m. Straightforward variation in conditions can produce shapes matching other TSAs. However, the observed particle fluxes on Bennu are approximately 3 orders of magnitude too low for this to be the only shaping mechanism on Bennu. The time necessary to form these shapes by our mechanism alone is far longer than the lifetimes of near-Earth asteroids, unless fluxes were once much greater, or there was an underlying oblate shape.",

Because of the slow normal zone propagation velocity, the long reliable quench detection method by directly monitoring coil voltage may not be timely for HTS anymore, leaving HTS magnets under danger of overheating. Using a NbTi low temperature superconducting (LTS) wire to detect quench in coils wound with ReBCO HTS tapes have recently been experimentally proved, yet a theoretical study is still needed to further develop this technique and make it prepared to be applied more generally in high field magnets. In this manuscript, we have demonstrated that it is the significant difference in the temperature dependence of critical current between LTS and HTS but not the normal zone propagation velocity (NZPV), that makes LTSs good quench detectors. Simulations show that LTS quench detectors should have low matrix fraction or high matrix resistivity. At last, at field up to 15 T or 20 T, Nb3Sn is proven to be a good quench detector.",

In this work, we present the first performance-portable, quasi-static, three-dimensional particle-in-cell code HiPACE++. By decomposing all the computation of a 3D domain in successive 2D transverse operations and choosing appropriate memory management, HiPACE++ demonstrates orders-of-magnitude speedups on modern scientific GPUs over CPU-only implementations. The 2D transverse operations are performed on a single GPU, avoiding time-consuming communications. The longitudinal parallelization is done through temporal domain decomposition, enabling near-optimal strong scaling from 1 to 512 GPUs. HiPACE++ is a modular, open-source code enabling efficient modeling of plasma accelerators from laptops to state-of-the-art supercomputers.",

      "abstract": "This work shows that even the Brownian motion of independent electrons in an electronic plasma under the influence of radiation reaction force can be described from a classical point of view, the effect due to the radiation reaction force is negligible. Our theoretical approach relies upon the classical generalized Langevin equation characterized by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck friction memory kernel with an effective correlation time. This correlation time accounts for two physical effects: the thermal interaction between electrons in a Brownian motion-like manner and the radiation reaction force. Due to this fact, a third-order time derivative stochastic differential equation is obtained where the coefficient of the acceleration time derivative is shown to be proportional to the effective correlation time. It is shown that the memory time, \u03c4, which accounts the thermal interaction between an electron with its surroundings is greater than the characteristic time \u03c4<SUB>e</SUB>.",

To construct coarse-grained models for such systems, one needs to integrate out a distribution of microstates that evolves in time. This is a challenging task. As a preparation to the topic, we recall equilibrium coarse-graining methods, both theoretical and numerical, such as projection operator formalisms, united atom simulations, numerical reconstruction of memory and Markov State Modelling. Then we review recent developments in theoretical approaches to the non-equilibrium coarse-graining problem, in particular, time-dependent projection operator formalisms, dynamic density functional theory and power functional theory, as well as numerical schemes to construct explicitly time-dependent memory kernels.",

      "abstract": "High power laser facilities have been developed to achieve novel standards in light-matter interactions. The repetition rate is severely limited by the heating of the large size components, and in particular the large-aperture amplifiers. Cooling these optical components turns out to be a major challenge for increasing the repetition rate of high power laser beam lines. Here we report a practical implementation of a large aperture Nd:phosphate split-slab based amplifier using a liquid cooling system. The amplification of a 90 \u00d7 90 mm<SUP>2</SUP> beam with a gain coefficient of 1.135 per pass and wave-front deformation lower than \u03bb /3 per pass is achieved with a repetition rate of 1 shot per minute. The cooling system is sufficient to maintain the gain as well as the beam quality over a long time operation. Additionally, the pressure inside the amplifier can be controlled to minimize the optical deformation. This single liquid-cooled amplifier is a promising step towards future beam-lines able to deliver hundreds of shots per day with beam quality compatible with target focusing applications.",

      "abstract": "We use cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations and semi-analytical models to study the effects of primordial black holes (PBHs) on first star formation. Our models self-consistently combine two competing effects: initial (isocurvature) perturbations induced by PBHs and BH accretion feedback. Focusing on PBHs with masses $\\sim 30\\, \\rm M_{\\odot }$, we find that the standard picture of first star formation in molecular-cooling minihaloes is not changed by PBHs, as the simulated star-forming gas clouds in the central parsec are very similar to those in the $\\rm \\Lambda CDM$ case when PBHs make up f<SUB>PBH</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>-4</SUP>-0.1 of dark matter. With a dynamical friction time-scale of $\\sim 2{\\!-\\!}10\\ \\rm Myr$ when the central gas density reaches $10^{5}\\ \\rm cm^{-3}$, it is also unlikely that PBHs can sink into star-forming discs and affect the evolution of protostars, although they may interact with the stars during the main-sequence stage. At larger scales, PBHs tend to shift star formation to more massive haloes and accelerate structure formation. The latter effect is stronger in regions with higher initial overdensities. For f<SUB>PBH</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>-4</SUP>-0.01 (allowed by observational constraints), the collapsed mass fraction of haloes hosting Population III stars is similar (within a factor of ~2 at z \u2272 30) to that in $\\rm \\Lambda CDM$, implying that the impact of stellar-mass PBHs on the cosmic star formation history at z \u2273 10 is small. We also find that the Lyman-Werner photons from PBH accretion in atomic-cooling haloes may facilitate the formation of direct-collapse BHs.",

      "abstract": "Peaking at 3.7 mag on 2020 July 11, YZ Ret was the second-brightest nova of the decade. The nova's moderate proximity (2.7 kpc, from Gaia) provided an opportunity to explore its multiwavelength properties in great detail. Here, we report on YZ Ret as part of a long-term project to identify the physical mechanisms responsible for high-energy emission in classical novae. We use simultaneous Fermi/LAT and NuSTAR observations complemented by XMM-Newton X-ray grating spectroscopy to probe the physical parameters of the shocked ejecta and the nova-hosting white dwarf. The XMM-Newton observations revealed a supersoft X-ray emission which is dominated by emission lines of C V, C VI, N VI, N VII, and O VIII rather than a blackbody-like continuum, suggesting CO-composition of the white dwarf in a high-inclination binary system. Fermi/LAT-detected YZ Ret for 15 d with the \u03b3-ray spectrum best described by a power law with an exponential cut-off at 1.9 \u00b1 0.6 GeV. In stark contrast with theoretical predictions and in keeping with previous NuSTAR observations of Fermi-detected classical novae (V5855 Sgr and V906 Car), the 3.5-78-keV X-ray emission is found to be two orders of magnitude fainter than the GeV emission. The X-ray emission observed by NuSTAR is consistent with a single-temperature thermal plasma model. We do not detect a non-thermal tail of the GeV emission expected to extend down to the NuSTAR band. NuSTAR observations continue to challenge theories of high-energy emission from shocks in novae.",

The bicoherence is a higher order statistic that can be used to probe the relation between the phases of a triplet of Fourier frequencies. Despite showing very similar power spectra, the observations exhibit different patterns in their bicoherence, indicating that the QPOs are phase coupled to the noise in different ways. We show that the bicoherence pattern exhibited correlates with the frequency of the QPO, the hardness ratio, as well as the radio properties of the source. In particular, we find that the nature of phase coupling between the QPO and the high and low frequency broad-band components is different between radio quiet, radio plateau, and radio steep conditions. We also investigate the phase lag behaviour of observations with QPO frequency above 2 Hz that show different bicoherence patterns and find statistically significant differences between them, indicating a change in the underlying physical mechanism. Finally, we present a scenario whereby the cooling of the jet electrons by soft photons from the accretion disc could explain the observed correlations between the bicoherence and radio properties.",

      "abstract": "Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) feedback has a major impact on to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth, the properties of the host galaxies, and their cosmic evolution. We investigate the effects of different kinetic feedback prescriptions on the observable properties of AGN and their host galaxies at z &gt; 6 in a suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations. We find that kinetic feedback decreases the column density of the interstellar medium (ISM) in the host galaxy by up to a factor of \u224d10, especially when the SMBHs reach high accretion rates ($\\approx 10{-}30\\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot \\, yr^{-1}}$). In particular, kinetic feedback is required to extend the ISM size to &gt;1 kpc and match the observed sizes of the gas reservoirs in z &gt; 6 AGN host galaxies. Moreover, it produces unobscured lines of sight along which the AGN can be detected in the rest-frame UV band with magnitudes consistent with observed values of z &gt; 6 AGN. The assumed geometry of the outflow plays an important role in shaping the observed properties of high-redshift AGN. We find that a biconical geometry is favoured over a spherical one to reproduce the observed properties, but it overestimates the number of multiple AGN systems detectable in X-ray observations. This result suggests that simplistic BH seeding recipes widely employed in cosmological simulations produce too many X-ray detectable multiple AGN at z = 6-7, thus soliciting the adoption of more physically motivated seeding prescriptions.",

      "abstract": "dimentation stability and high yield stress of a magnetorheological fluid (MRFs) are essential parameters for better damping performance for any practical application. Preliminary investigations have been carried out on carbonyl iron particles to determine the morphology, particle size, crystal structure, and saturation magnetization for their feasibility of synthesizing magnetorheological fluids in-house. This study synthesizes various MRFs from various commonly used carrier oils and additives. The MRF samples were prepared for 25% volume fractions of carbonyl iron (CI) powder in either silicone oil (350cSt) or hydraulic oil (50cSt) and by using lithium and calcium-based additives or a combination of both the additives. The sedimentation stability and yield behaviour at different temperatures show a remarkable drop in sedimentation rate and yield stress for all the MR fluid samples. The characterization of the prepared MR fluids reveals that MRF-1, MRF-3, MRF-5 are more stable and have high yield stress values. MRF-1 is selected to further characterize its dynamic performance in magnetorheological damper fabricated based on geometric dimensions obtained from the response surface optimization technique. The results indicate a 164.45% and 135.48% increase in damping force at higher amplitude and higher frequencies at 0A and 1A currents. Further, similar tests have been carried out by synthesizing MRF-7 with silicone oil (50cSt) + lithium base grease as the additive. The sample's stability and yield stress with temperature are carried out, and performance analysis shows a remarkable change in damping force than MRF-1. The dynamic range obtained is practically viable in MRF-7 than MRF-1, with less variability. Finally, temperature characteristics captured from the thermocouple of the MR damper reveal that an average of 43.78% reduction in damping force when the temperature is increased by 19.5 \u00b0C with increased dynamic range.",

      "abstract": "A hybrid smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) coupled to a direct-forcing fictitious domain (FD) scheme is proposed for the simulation of particulate flows. The new method is effective in calculating the particle-fluid interaction forces and uses a kernel interpolation function to realize the momentum exchange between fluids and particles. A higher-order interpolation scheme is applied to preserve the consistency and accuracy of the kernel function. We first test our method by simulating the benchmark of flow past a cylinder at Reynolds number ranging from 20 to 200 and obtain the convergent results, including accurate lift and drag coefficients, Strouhal number, length of the recirculation bubble, and separation angle. Subsequently, we verify our new method for the typical particulate flows, including the motion of a neutrally-buoyant cylinder in Couette flow, the motion of a neutrally-buoyant cylinder in a planar Poiseuille flow, the sedimentation of a circular cylinder in a channel, and the motion of a neutrally-buoyant slender particle in Couette flow. A good agreement with the existing experimental data, with other numerical results, and with available theoretical solutions is obtained indicating the accuracy and the robustness of the new method. Subsequently, our SPH-FD is applied to simulate a slender fiber in a three-dimensional (3D) printing process, showing a good potential and advantages in simulating particulate flows of some industrial processes.",

It has been widely used in couplers, filters, polarizers, optical attenuators, photodetectors, modulators, and sensors for temperature, humidity, strain, biological molecules, chemical gas, and vector magnetic monitoring. In this article, an overview of the development history, fabrication techniques, fiber types, transmission characteristics, and varied recent applications of SPFs are reviewed. Firstly, the fabrication techniques of SPFs are reviewed, including the V-groove assisted polishing technique and wheel polishing technique. Then, the different types of SPFs and their characteristics are discussed. Finally, various applications of SPFs are discussed and concluded theoretically and experimentally, including their principles and structures. When designing the device, the residual thickness and polishing lengths of the SPF need to be appropriately selected in order to obtain the best performance. Developing all-fiber devices and sensors is aimed at practical usability under harsh environments and allows to avoid the high coupling loss between optical fibers and on-chip integrated devices.",

However, current efforts to inhibit this phenomenon based on simple cation and anion alloying strategies continue to suffer from unintended consequences, such as unfavorable shifts in the bandgap energy and unwanted phase separation during operation. The present work compares the effects of bromine (Br) anion and dimethylamine (DMA) cation alloying on the structure and properties of FAPbI<SUB>3</SUB> perovskite in detail. DMA-incorporated FAPbI<SUB>3</SUB> perovskites show significantly improved structural stability and photovoltaic performance, while the inherent bandgap energy of the original material is maintained. Rigorous analyses demonstrate that the relatively large size and free isotropic motion of the incorporated DMA cations constrain the dynamic space of neighboring FA cations, which increases the degree to which the FA cations interact with the inorganic lattice and therefore stabilizes the PbI<SUB>6</SUB> lattice structure without significant lattice distortion. Hence, this work demonstrates an efficient method for improving the phase stability of FAPbI<SUB>3</SUB> perovskite materials while providing a plausible molecular mechanism for the stability engendered by the alloying of DMA and FA.",

      "abstract": "Strong electron-phonon interactions are frequently considered the origin of the unique electrical and optical properties of lead halide perovskites. Electron-phonon interactions induce the formation of a polaron, which is a charge carrier dressed with a phonon cloud. The details of polaron formation are crucial for carrier transport since polaron formation leads to a larger effective mass of a carrier. Several mechanisms have been proposed regarding the physics of polaron formation in halide perovskites, but the details are still under active debate. While the Fr\u00f6hlich interaction plays an essential role in ionic crystals, we also need to consider the strong phonon anharmonicity of halide perovskites that may lead to the formation of an unconventional polaron. In this review article, we discuss the uniqueness of perovskite semiconductors from the viewpoint of electron-phonon interactions. We review the experimental results and the proposed models concerning the effective carrier mass and carrier mobility. Finally, we briefly explain two physical phenomena related to strong electron-phonon interactions: strong anti-Stokes photoluminescence and slow hot-carrier cooling.",

      "abstract": "Nonferric oxidant precursors have the unique advantage of directly polymerizing poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-inorganic composites. However, due to limited solubility and unmatched oxidation potentials, most oxidants only produce powders or porous materials. To obtain high-quality films with improved homogeneity and controllable particle sizes, the oxidants should be adaptable to high-standard PEDOT film fabrication techniques such as vapor phase polymerization (VPP). In this work, we discovered for the first time a nonferric metal salt suitable for the VPP process. With the addition of an Fe(III) salt to stabilize the reaction and adjust the oxidant ratio, micron-thick antibacterial S-PEDOT-Ag quantum dot (QD) composite films with tunable Ag wt% can be synthesized in one facile step. With a low Ag loading of ~0.2 wt%, the film exhibited an optimized power factor of 63.1 \u03bcW/mK<SUP>2</SUP>, which is among the highest values thus far reported for PEDOT-metal composites. Increase of the Ag(I) concentration in the precursor to a certain level may lead to minor decomposition of the polymer followed by the formation of Ag<SUB>2</SUB>S particles.",

      "abstract": "The chondrogenesis of stem cells and cartilage tissue regeneration are more efficient in a three-dimensional (3D) environment than in a two-dimensional (2D) environment. Although extensive studies have examined the effects of biochemical or physical cues alone, it is not fully understood how these biochemical and biophysical cues in the 3D environment are intertwined and orchestrated with chondrogenesis for cartilage tissue regeneration. In this study, we used photocrosslinked hyaluronic acid (HA), the extracellular matrix of cartilage, as a general 3D microenvironment to characterize the effects of dimensionality, localization of biochemical cues, regulation of biophysical cues, and external stimulation on chondrogenic signaling pathways in adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs). TGF-\u03b23 was immobilized in HA hydrogels by ionic or covalent conjugation. The stiffness of the hydrogels was tuned by varying the crosslinking density, and an external stimulus for chondrogenesis was provided by ultrasound. The results revealed that the levels of chondrogenic signals in hASCs cultured in the 3D HA hydrogel depended on the presence of TGF-\u03b23, and a reduction in the stiffness of the TGF-\u03b23 covalent conjugated hydrogel increased the chance of interaction with encapsulated hASCs, leading to an increase in chondrogenic signals. External stimulation with ultrasound increased the interaction of hASCs with HA via CD44, thereby increasing chondrogenesis. Our results present a new understanding of the intertwined mechanisms of chondrogenesis in 3D hydrogels connecting TGF-\u03b23 sequestration, mechanical properties, and ultrasound-based external stimulation. Overall, our results suggest that when designing novel biomaterials for tissue engineering, it is necessary to consider the combinatorial mechanism of action in 3D microenvironments.",

      "abstract": "Recently, spin-bearing molecules have been experimentally demonstrated to have great potential as building blocks for quantum information processing due to their substantial advantages including tunability, portability, and scalability. Here, we propose a theoretical model based on the theory of open quantum systems for spin dynamics in a molecule containing one radical, which can interact with the triplet state arising from another part of the molecule owing to optical excitation and intersystem crossing. With the initial state being a classical mixture of a radical 1/2 ?-spin, the exchange interaction between the radical and the triplet produces a spin coherent state, which could potentially be used for a qubit-qutrit quantum entangling gate. Our calculations for the time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra showed good qualitative agreement with the related experimental results for radical-bearing molecules at high temperature (~77 K, the boiling point of liquid nitrogen). This work therefore lays a solid theoretical cornerstone for optically driven quantum gate operations in radical-bearing molecular materials, aiming toward high-temperature quantum information processing.",

To improve the energy efficiency of magnetic cores, it is important to understand the mechanism of energy loss under oscillating magnetic fields. Here, we clarify the mechanism of energy loss in nanocrystalline soft magnetic materials (NSMMs), which are candidates for energy-efficient magnetic cores. To investigate the energy loss of an NSMM, it is necessary to consider the interaction between the magnetization and the crystal lattice, i.e., magnetostriction. However, the random distributions of crystalline axes in nanocrystals hinder magnetostriction calculation. We developed a micromagnetic simulation program by formulating the effective fields due to magnetostriction in randomly oriented nanocrystallites. We performed micromagnetic simulations of NSMMs under an oscillating magnetic field and found that the magnetic energy of the moving domain wall dissipates into the elastic energy of the crystal lattice through magnetostriction. These results can enable the design of highly energy-efficient NSMMs.",

The CME coupling coefficient of the polycrystalline Co<SUB>2</SUB>FeSi/PMN-PT(011) is over 1.0 \u00d7 10<SUP>\u22125 </SUP>s/m at room temperature, comparable to those of single-crystalline Fe<SUB>1-x</SUB>Ga<SUB>x</SUB>/PMN-PT systems.

Sn has been replaced with various lower group dopants to achieve successful p-type doping in SnSe with high ZT values.

Through transport and scanning tunneling microscopy studies, we discovered that V<SUB>Sn</SUB> are dominant in high-quality (slow cooling rate) SnSe single crystals, while multiple vacancies, V<SUB>multi,</SUB> are dominant in low-quality (high cooling rate) single crystals. Surprisingly, both V<SUB>Sn</SUB> and V<SUB>multi</SUB> help to increase the power factors of SnSe, whereas samples with dominant V<SUB>Sn</SUB> have superior thermoelectric properties in SnSe single crystals. Additionally, the observation that V<SUB>multi</SUB> are good p-type sources observed in relatively low-quality single crystals is useful in thermoelectric applications because polycrystalline SnSe can be used due to its mechanical strength; this substance is usually fabricated at very high cooling speeds.",

Here, we report on the growth of GeS microribbons via chemical vapor transport (CVT), which affords each of them with a low-symmetry orthorhombic structure and anisotropic optical and electronic properties. The single-crystalline nature of the GeS microribbon, which has a typical thickness of ~30 nm, is confirmed. Polarized Raman spectra reveal angle-dependent intensities that are attributed to the anisotropic layered structure of GeS microribbons. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra reveal a peak at ~1.66 eV. The angle-dependent PL and anisotropic absorption spectroscopy results provide evidence for a distinct anisotropic optical transition near the energy band edges; this phenomenon is also predicted by our density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. Strong in-plane direct-current transport anisotropy is observed under dark and white illumination by using back-gate cross-shaped field effect transistors (CSFETs) fabricated with the GeS microribbon; significant gate-tunable conductivity is also confirmed. The strong anisotropy is further confirmed by the DFT-calculated effective mass ratio.

High-sensitivity and flexible piezoelectric sensors were fabricated using dimension- and position-controlled, vertical, and free-standing ZnO nanotubes on a graphene substrate. Significant pressure/force responses were achieved from small devices composed of only single, 3 \u00d7 3, 5 \u00d7 5, and 250 \u00d7 250 ZnO nanotube arrays on graphene. An individually addressable pixel matrix was fabricated by arranging the top and bottom electrodes of the sensors in a crossbar configuration. We investigated the uniformity and robustness of pressure/force spatial mapping by considering the pixel size, the number of ZnO nanotubes in each pixel, and the lateral dimensions of individual ZnO nanotubes. A spatial resolution as high as 1058 dpi was achieved for a Schottky diode-based force/pressure sensor composed of ZnO nanotubes on a flexible substrate. Additionally, we confirmed the excellent flexibility and electrical robustness of the free-standing sensor arrays for high-resolution tactile imaging. We believe that this work opens important opportunities for 1D piezoelectric pressure/force sensor arrays with enormous applications in human-electronics interfaces, smart skin, and micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems.",

Here, we used coaxial microfluidic electrospray technology to generate microcapsules allowing high cell viability (&gt;90%) with porous alginate shells and \u03b2 cell-containing cores in less than half an hour. Benefitting from microfluidic electrospray, the sizes of the generated microcapsules were adjustable. The biocompatible porous hydrogel shell not only protected \u03b2 cells from immune rejection but also allowed the exchange of small molecular nutrients during transplantation, and the liquid core guaranteed the high viability of the encapsulated cells. This constructed living cell biosystem further demonstrated its potential as an artificial islet after transplantation into the omental pouches of diabetic mice to control blood glucose levels and thus treat diabetes. We consider that this system, with an elaborate structure and an abundance of highly viable encapsulated \u03b2 cells to improve treatment performance, could be applied in a wide range of clinical situations.",

Characterization of these microstructures is the fundamental issue to improve the optical, mechanical, and biochemical performance of functionalized hydrogels. With the rapid development of fluorescence microscopy, a growing number of researchers have attempted to utilize this easily operated, noninvasive, and high-contrast technique to visualize the fine microstructure of hydrogels. Integration of a confocal system into fluorescence microscopy allows the sectioning and reconstruction of 3D hydrogel networks. The live recording function offers in situ and real-time images of dynamic behaviors within hydrogels. The development of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy has significantly promoted imaging quality from the submicron scale to the nanoscale. Based on these spectacular achievements, we reviewed the recent advances in fluorescence microscopic visualization of internal morphologies, mechanical properties, and dynamic structural changes. The scope of this review is to provide inspiration for researchers in chemistry, material science, and biology to study and fabricate functionalized hydrogels with the assistance of fluorescence microscopic visualization.",

      "abstract": "With the growing interest in wearable devices in recent decades, considerable effort has been devoted to developing mechanical elastomeric devices such as sensors, transistors, logic circuits, and integrated circuits. To successfully implement elastomeric devices subjected to large mechanical deformations or stretching, all the components, including conductors, semiconductors, and dielectrics, must have high stability and mechanical sustainability. Elastomeric conductors, which exhibit excellent electrical performances under mechanical deformations, are key components of elastomeric devices. Herein, we prepared fully elastomeric electrodes based on interconnected 2D gold nanosheets (AuNSs) to develop mechanically resilient integrated electronics. The AuNS elastomeric electrodes exhibited a sheet resistance of less than 2 \u03a9/sq under 50% stretching and sustained 100,000 stretching-releasing cycles. These electrodes with a dedicated design were used in combination with elastomeric semiconductors of P3HT nanofibrils in the PDMS elastomer (P3NF/PDMS) and an ion gel as a dielectric to realize elastomeric transistors, inverters, and NOR and NAND logic gates. Additionally, an elastomeric 8 \u00d7 8 transistor array that can sustain various types of mechanical stimuli was successfully demonstrated. Furthermore, the elastomeric electronic devices implemented on a soft robot showed no interfering performances during robot gripping motion. The proposed framework is expected to aid in the rapid development and broaden the application scope of soft electronics.",

In topological crystalline insulators, on the other hand, crystal symmetry plays a key role in protecting surface states. Therefore, perturbation breaking time-reversal or crystal symmetry induces a phase transition to a conventional band insulator. In dual topological insulators (DTIs), in which time-reversal and crystal symmetries coexist, the topological character is more robust against perturbation. Here, we propose that NaZnBi is a new DTI with Z<SUB>2</SUB>? invariants (\u03bd<SUB>0</SUB>;\u03bd<SUB>1</SUB>\u03bd<SUB>2</SUB>\u03bd<SUB>3</SUB> ) =(1 ;000 ) ? and odd mirror Chern numbers \u00b11. We find that the characteristic Dirac cone is preserved even if either time-reversal or mirror symmetry is broken, verifying the robustness of the DTI phase. Given that gapless surface states can be experimentally observable even under perturbations that break any lattice symmetry or time-reversal, NaZnBi can be a good candidate material for future device applications.",

      "abstract": "Silicon carbide (SiC) aims to be the number one material for power microelectronics due to its remarkable thermal properties. Recent progress in SiC technology finally enabled the fabrication of crystalline SiC nanostructures. Yet, the thermal properties of SiC at the nanoscale remain overlooked. Here, we systematically study heat conduction in SiC nanostructures, including nanomembranes, nanowires, and phononic crystals. Our measurements show that the thermal conductivity of nanostructures is several times lower than that in bulk and that the values scale proportionally to the narrowest dimension of the structures. In the smallest nanostructures, the thermal conductivity reached 10% of that in bulk. To better understand nanoscale thermal transport in SiC, we also probed phonon mean free path and coherent heat conduction in the nanostructures. Our theoretical model links the observed suppression of heat conduction with the surface phonon scattering, which limits the phonon mean free path and thus reduces the thermal conductivity. This work uncovers thermal characteristics of SiC nanostructures and explains their origin, thus enabling realistic thermal engineering in SiC microelectronics.",

      "abstract": "Solid-state refrigeration based on the caloric effect is viewed as a promising efficient and clean refrigeration technology. Barocaloric materials were developed rapidly but have since encountered a general obstacle: the prominent caloric effect cannot be utilized reversibly under moderate pressure. Here, we report a mechanism of an emergent large, reversible barocaloric effect (BCE) under low pressure in the hybrid organic-inorganic layered perovskite (CH<SUB>3</SUB>-(CH<SUB>2</SUB>)<SUB>n\u22121</SUB>-NH<SUB>3</SUB>)<SUB>2</SUB>MnCl<SUB>4</SUB> (n = 9,10), which show the reversible barocaloric entropy change as high as \u0394S<SUB>r</SUB> \u223c 218, 230 J kg<SUP>\u22121</SUP> K<SUP>\u22121</SUP> at 0.08 GPa around the transition temperature (T<SUB>s</SUB> \u223c 294, 311.5 K). To reveal the mechanism, single-crystal (CH<SUB>3</SUB>-(CH<SUB>2</SUB>)<SUB>n\u22121</SUB>-NH<SUB>3</SUB>)<SUB>2</SUB>MnCl<SUB>4</SUB> (n = 10) was successfully synthesized, and high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) was carried out. Then, the underlying mechanism was determined by combining infrared (IR) spectroscopy and density function theory (DFT) calculations. The colossal reversible BCE and the very small hysteresis of 2.6 K (0.1 K/min) and 4.0 K (1 K/min) are closely related to the specific hybrid organic-inorganic structure and single-crystal nature. The drastic transformation of organic chains confined to the metallic frame from ordered rigidity to disordered flexibility is responsible for the large phase-transition entropy comparable to the melting entropy of organic chains. This study provides new insights into the design of novel barocaloric materials by utilizing the advantages of specific organic-inorganic hybrid characteristics.",

      "abstract": "Despite extensive research on quasi-ballistic phonon transport, anomalous phonon transport is still observed in numerous nanostructures. Herein, we investigate the transport characteristics of two sets of samples: straight beams and nanoladders comprising two straight beams orthogonally connected with bridges. A combination of experiments and analysis with a Boltzmann transport model suggests that the boundary scattering within the bridges considerably dictates the distribution of phonon mean free paths, despite its negligible contribution to the net heat flux. Statistical analysis of those boundary scatterings shows that phonons with large axial angles are filtered into bridges, creating dead spaces in the line-of-sight channels. Such redistribution induces L\u00e9vy walk conduction along the line-of-sight channels, causing the remaining phonons within the bridges to exhibit Brownian motion. Phonon conduction in the nanoladders is suppressed below that of the straight beams with equivalent cross-sectional areas due to trapped phonons within the bridges. Our work reveals the origin of unusual thermal conductivity suppression at the nanoscale, suggesting a method to modulate phonon conduction via systematic nanostructuring.",

The CD units acted as movable crosslinking points in the obtained SC elastomer. Introducing movable crosslinks into a poly(ethyl acrylate/butyl acrylate) copolymer resulted in good toughness (G<SUB>f</SUB>) and stress dispersion. Here, to improve the Young's modulus (E) and G<SUB>f</SUB> of movable cross-network elastomers, the bulk copolymerization of liquid alkyl acrylate monomer swelling in SC gave another type of movable cross-network elastomer with penetrating polymers (SCPs). Moreover, the bulk copolymerization of alkyl acrylate and the CD monomer in the presence of SC resulted in dual cross-network (DC) elastomers. The G<SUB>f</SUB> of the DC elastomer with a suitable weight % (wt%) of the secondary movable cross-network polymer was higher than those of the SCP or SC elastomers. The combination of suitable hydrophobicity and glass transition of the secondary network was important for improving G<SUB>f</SUB>. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) indicated that the DC elastomers exhibited heterogeneity at the nanoscale. The DC elastomers showed a significantly broader relaxation time distribution than the SC and SCP elastomers. Thus, the nanoscale heterogeneity and broader relaxation time distribution were important to increase G<SUB>f</SUB>. This method to fabricate SCP and DC elastomers with penetrating polymers would be applicable to improve the G<SUB>f</SUB> of conventional polymeric materials.",

Despite some interesting results on Dirac- to Weyl-semimetal phase transitions under conditions of low temperature or strong magnetic field (B), all of them are reversible phenomena. Here, we report for the first time a possible permanent transition in a single TSM by ion implantation. A Dirac- to Weyl-semimetal phase transition in a Bi<SUB>0.96</SUB>Sb<SUB>0.04</SUB> DSM results from inversion-symmetry breaking induced by implantation with nonmagnetic Au ions for implant fluences (\u03d5<SUB>G</SUB>) \u2265 3.2 \u00d7 10<SUP>16</SUP> Au cm<SUP>\u22122</SUP>. This phenomenon is evidenced by the \u03d5<SUB>G</SUB>-dependent behavior of the Raman spectra and quantum-oscillation parameters extracted from magnetoresistance (MR) measurements, which show abrupt changes at \u03d5<SUB>G</SUB> \u2265 3.2 \u00d7 10<SUP>16</SUP> Au cm<SUP>\u22122</SUP>. The verification of the transition is further supported by observations of negative MR in the longitudinal B // electric field orientation, indicating the existence of a chiral anomaly in Weyl fermions induced by implantation with nonmagnetic Au ions. In contrast, implantation with magnetic Mn ions exhibits no such particular behavior. Our findings demonstrate the first realization of a possible permanent DSM-to-WSM phase transition in a single material by the simple approach of implantation using nonmagnetic elements.",

      "abstract": "Barocaloric materials are particularly promising for green and efficient solid-state cooling technology because of their great potential in terms of cooling performance. However, intermetallic materials with outstanding barocaloric effects under low hydrostatic pressure are especially lacking, which has severely delayed the development of barocaloric refrigeration. Here, in a rare-earth intermetallic La-Ce-Fe-Si-H, we achieve a giant specific barocaloric temperature change of 8 K per kbar according to direct measurements of the adiabatic temperature change \u0394T<SUB>BCE</SUB> under hydrostatic pressure, which is confirmed by a phenomenological transition simulation. This barocaloric strength is significantly better than those in previously reported phase-transitioned alloys. By using a cutting-edge in situ neutron diffraction technique operating under simultaneously varying temperature, magnetic field, and hydrostatic pressure, we reveal that the large isotropic transition volume change in La-Ce-Fe-Si-H plays a crucial role in the giant barocaloric effect. Additionally, we employ Landau expansion theory to demonstrate that the high sensitivity of the transition temperature to the applied pressure produces the sizable \u0394T<SUB>BCE</SUB> in the itinerant electron metamagnetic transition alloys. Our results provide insight into the development of high-performance barocaloric materials and related cooling systems.",

      "abstract": "Pigmentary coloration can produce viewing angle-independent uniform colors via light absorption by chromophores. However, due to the limited diversity in the changes of the molecular configuration of chromophores to undergo color change, the existing materials cannot produce a wide range of visible colors with tunable color saturation and transmittance. Herein, we propose a novel strategy to create materials with a wide visible color range and highly tunable color saturation and transmittance. We fabricated a hydrogel with poly (acrylamide-co-dopamine acrylamide) networks swollen with Fe<SUP>3+</SUP>-containing glycerol/water in which the covalently crosslinked polyacrylamide backbone with pendant catechols can ensure that the hydrogel maintains a very stable shape. Hydrogels containing adjustable catechol-Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> coordination bonds with flexible light-interacting configuration changes can display a wide range of visible colors based on the complementary color principle. The catechol-Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> complexes can dynamically switch between noncoordinated and mono-, bis- and tris-coordinated states to harvest light energy from a specific wavelength across the whole visible spectrum. Therefore, these hydrogels can be yellow, green, blue, and red, covering the three primary colors. Moreover, color saturation and transmittance can be flexibly manipulated by simply adjusting the Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> content in the hydrogel networks. The versatility of these smart hydrogels has been demonstrated through diverse applications, including optical filters for color regulation and colorimetric sensors for detecting UV light and chemical vapors. This proposed smart hydrogel provides a universal color-switchable platform for the development of multifunctional optical systems such as optical filters, sensors, and detectors.",

To this end, a synthetic LC-OSC molecule, MeOPh-BTBT-C8, with a fluidic nematic (N) phase that is essential for alignment control over a large area and a smectic E (SmE) phase showing high ordering, was prepared. A simple flipping of a sandwich cell made of the LC-OSC material between the top and bottom substrates that have uniaxial-planar degenerated alignment as well as crossed rubbing directions responds to the given surface anchoring condition and temperature gradient. Optical observation of the alignment-controlled LC-OSC was carried out by polarized optical microscopy (POM), and the corresponding charge carrier mobility was also measured by fabricating organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Our platform offers a facile approach for multidirectional and multifunctional organic electronic devices using the stimulus-response characteristics of LC materials.",

Therefore, it is important to determine the rheological properties of aqueous s-hectorite dispersions in terms of the CNS microstructures formed in the dispersion. Herein, viscosity changes in aqueous dispersions of s-hectorite were determined using a vibration viscometer to measure viscosity under agitated and static conditions. Upon varying the pH and salt concentration, aqueous dispersions of s-hectorite exhibited a maximum viscosity accompanied by gelation. Additionally, the aqueous dispersion with maximum viscosity exhibited large and complex time-dependent viscosity changes in the static state after cessation of stirring. The anomalous viscosity dynamics depended on the types of clay, acid (salt), temperature, repetitions, and agitation conditions used. The mechanisms for viscosity dynamics have been discussed in terms of variations in the CNS microstructures. It is inferred that anomalous viscosity dynamics are a general phenomenon in multicomponent dispersion systems containing CNSs.",

In this review, I discuss the long-term evolution of the solar wind, including the evolution of observed properties that are intimately linked to the solar wind: rotation, magnetism and activity. Given that we cannot access data from the solar wind 4 billion years ago, this review relies on stellar data, in an effort to better place the Sun and the solar wind in a stellar context. I overview some clever detection methods of winds of solar-like stars, and derive from these an observed evolutionary sequence of solar wind mass-loss rates. I then link these observational properties (including, rotation, magnetism and activity) with stellar wind models. I conclude this review then by discussing implications of the evolution of the solar wind on the evolving Earth and other solar system planets. I argue that studying exoplanetary systems could open up new avenues for progress to be made in our understanding of the evolution of the solar wind.",

Studying the propagation of Galactic cosmic rays through the astrospheres of M dwarfs is important to understand the effect on their orbiting planets. Here, we focus on the planetary system GJ 436. We perform simulations using a combined 1D cosmic ray transport model and 1D Alfv\u00e9n-wave-driven stellar wind model. We use two stellar wind set-ups: one more magnetically dominated and the other more thermally dominated. Although our stellar winds have similar magnetic field and velocity profiles, they have mass-loss rates two orders of magnitude different. Because of this, they give rise to two different astrosphere sizes, one 10 times larger than the other. The magnetically dominated wind modulates the Galactic cosmic rays more at distances $\\lt 0.2\\,$ au than the thermally dominated wind due to a higher local wind velocity. Between 0.2 and 1 au the fluxes for both cases start to converge. However, for distances $\\gt 10\\,$ au, spatial diffusion dominates, and the flux of GeV cosmic rays is almost unmodulated. We find, irrespective of the wind regime, that the flux of Galactic cosmic rays in the habitable zone of GJ 436 (0.2-0.4 au) is comparable with intensities observed at Earth. On the other hand, around GJ 436 b (0.028 au), both wind regimes predict Galactic cosmic ray fluxes that are approximately 10<SUP>4</SUP> times smaller than the values observed at Earth.",

      "abstract": "Context. The direct imaging of rocky exoplanets is one of the major science goals of upcoming large telescopes. The contrast requirement for imaging such planets is challenging. However, the mid-IR (infrared) regime provides the optimum contrast to directly detect the thermal signatures of exoplanets in our solar neighbourhood. <BR /> Aims: We aim to exploit novel fast-chopping techniques newly developed for astronomy with the aid of adaptive optics to look for thermal signatures of exoplanets around bright stars in the solar neighbourhood. <BR /> Methods: We used the upgraded Very Large Telescope Imager and Spectrometer for the mid-InfraRed (VISIR) instrument with high-contrast imaging capability optimised for observations at 10 \u03bcm to look for exoplanets around five nearby (d &lt; 4 pc) stars. The instrument provides an improved signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) by a factor of ~4 in the N-band compared to standard VISIR for a given S/N and time. <BR /> Results: In this work, we achieve a detection sensitivity of sub-mJy, which is sufficient to detect a few Jupiter mass planets in nearby systems. Although no detections are made, we achieve most sensitive limits within &lt;2\u2033 for all the observed targets compared to previous campaigns. For \u03f5 Indi A and \u03f5 Eri, we achieve detection limits very close to the giant planets discovered by RV, with the limits on \u03f5 Indi A being the most sensitive to date. Our non-detection therefore supports an older age for \u03f5 Indi A. The results presented here are promising for high-contrast imaging and exoplanet detections in the mid-IR regime.",

      "abstract": "High-resolution UV spectra of stellar H I Ly\u03b1 lines from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) provide observational constraints on the winds of coronal main-sequence stars, thanks to an astrospheric absorption signature created by the interaction between the stellar winds and the interstellar medium. We report the results of a new HST survey of M dwarf stars, yielding six new detections of astrospheric absorption. We estimate mass-loss rates for these detections and upper limits for nondetections. These new constraints allow us to characterize the nature of M dwarf winds and their dependence on coronal activity for the first time. For a clear majority of the M dwarfs, we find winds that are weaker than or comparable in strength to that of the Sun, i.e., $\\dot{M}\\leqslant 1\\,{\\dot{M}}_{\\odot }$ . However, two of the M dwarfs have much stronger winds: YZ CMi (M4 Ve; $\\dot{M}=30\\,{\\dot{M}}_{\\odot }$ ) and GJ 15AB (M2 V+M3.5 V; $\\dot{M}=10\\,{\\dot{M}}_{\\odot }$ ). Even these winds are much weaker than expectations if the solar relation between flare energy and coronal mass ejection (CME) mass extended to M dwarfs. Thus, the solar flare/CME relation does not appear to apply to M dwarfs, with important ramifications for the habitability of exoplanets around M dwarfs. There is evidence for some increase in $\\dot{M}$ with coronal activity as quantified by X-ray flux, but with much scatter. One or more other factors must be involved in determining wind strength besides spectral type and coronal activity, with magnetic topology being one clear possibility. * Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program GO-15326.",

      "abstract": "Energetic particles, such as stellar cosmic rays, produced at a heightened rate by active stars (like the young Sun) may have been important for the origin of life on Earth and other exoplanets. Here, we compare, as a function of stellar rotation rate (\u03a9), contributions from two distinct populations of energetic particles: stellar cosmic rays accelerated by impulsive flare events and Galactic cosmic rays. We use a 1.5D stellar wind model combined with a spatially 1D cosmic ray transport model. We formulate the evolution of the stellar cosmic ray spectrum as a function of stellar rotation. The maximum stellar cosmic ray energy increases with increasing rotation, i.e. towards more active/younger stars. We find that stellar cosmic rays dominate over Galactic cosmic rays in the habitable zone at the pion threshold energy for all stellar ages considered ($t_*=0.6\\!-\\!2.9\\,$ Gyr). However, even at the youngest age, $t_*=0.6\\,$ Gyr, we estimate that $\\gtrsim \\, 80$ MeV stellar cosmic ray fluxes may still be transient in time. At ~1 Gyr when life is thought to have emerged on Earth, we demonstrate that stellar cosmic rays dominate over Galactic cosmic rays up to ~4 GeV energies during flare events. Our results for t<SUB>*</SUB> = 0.6 Gyr (\u03a9 = 4 \u03a9<SUB>\u2299</SUB>) indicate that \u2272GeV stellar cosmic rays are advected from the star to 1 au and are impacted by adiabatic losses in this region. The properties of the inner solar wind, currently being investigated by the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter, are thus important for accurate calculations of stellar cosmic rays around young Sun-like stars.",

      "abstract": "Context. The FIELDS instrument onboard Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observes dust impacts on the spacecraft. The derived dust flux rates suggest that the particles originate from the vicinities of the Sun and are ejected by radiation pressure. Radiation pressure typically ejects particles of several 100 nm and smaller, which are also affected by the electromagnetic force. <BR /> Aims: We aim to understand the influence of the electromagnetic force on the dust trajectories and to predict the dust fluxes along the orbit of PSP, within 1 AU and near Earth. <BR /> Methods: We study the trajectories of dust particles influenced by gravity, radiation pressure, and the electromagnetic force assuming that pitch-angle scattering can be neglected (scatter-free approximation). We estimate the dust fluxes along the second orbit of PSP and in the vicinity of the Earth based on average dust velocities derived from the trajectory calculations and dust production rates derived from a fragmentation model. <BR /> Results: The calculated cumulative flux of dust particles larger than 100 nm is of the same order (within a factor of ~2) as implied by PSP observations. In this size interval, the dynamics of most particles is dominated by the radiation pressure force. The Lorentz force becomes more important for smaller particles and fluxes can vary with magnetic field conditions. The calculated flux of the 30 to 75 nm particles at the PSP is negligible for most of the second orbit, except for an isolated peak at the perihelion. The 30-75 nm particles that were created inwards from 0.16 AU from the Sun are in trapped orbits if the radiation pressure force is weaker than gravity, which is the case for dust from asteroids and for cometary dust that was altered in space. <BR /> Conclusions: The inner Solar System is the most likely source of dust smaller than 100 nm that enters Earth's atmosphere and our results suggest the flux is time-variable.",

The simulations predict only modest velocity or temperature perturbations attending the foreshock compressional/cavity boundaries. However, they predict pronounced flow enhancements and depressed temperatures accompanying the enhanced densities and magnetic field strengths on foreshock compressional/cavity boundaries transmitted into the magnetosheath. Many of these properties are similar to those of magnetosheath jets, previously attributed to processes occurring at locations where the solar wind flow makes a grazing encounter with a locally oblique bow shock. Simultaneous THEMIS observations upstream and downstream from the Earth's bow shock from 1430 to 1630 UT on June 14, 2007 confirm simulation predictions for the direct transmission of foreshock cavities into the magnetosheath. Foreshock cavity density and magnetic field strength perturbations diminish very rapidly with distance upstream from the bow shock.",

      "abstract": "Hot Jupiters provide valuable natural laboratories for studying potential contributions of high-energy radiation to pre-biotic synthesis in the atmospheres of exoplanets. In this fourth paper of the Multiwavelength Observations of an eVaporating Exoplanet and its Star (MOVES) programme, we study the effect of different types of high-energy radiation on the production of organic and pre-biotic molecules in the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b. Our model combines X-ray and UV observations from the MOVES programme and 3D climate simulations from the 3D Met Office Unified Model to simulate the atmospheric composition and kinetic chemistry with the STAND2019 network. Also, the effects of galactic cosmic rays and stellar energetic particles are included. We find that the differences in the radiation field between the irradiated dayside and the shadowed nightside lead to stronger changes in the chemical abundances than the variability of the host star's XUV emission. We identify ammonium (NH<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>) and oxonium (H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUP>+</SUP>) as fingerprint ions for the ionization of the atmosphere by both galactic cosmic rays and stellar particles. All considered types of high-energy radiation have an enhancing effect on the abundance of key organic molecules such as hydrogen cyanide (HCN), formaldehyde (CH<SUB>2</SUB>O), and ethylene (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>4</SUB>). The latter two are intermediates in the production pathway of the amino acid glycine (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>NO<SUB>2</SUB>) and abundant enough to be potentially detectable by JWST.",

      "abstract": "It has been proposed that spin-polarized cosmic radiation can induce asymmetric changes in helical biopolymers that may account for the emergence of biological homochirality. The parity violation in the weak interaction has direct consequences on the transport of polarization in cosmic ray showers. In this paper, we show that muons retain their polarization down to energies at which they can initiate enantioselective mutagenesis. Therefore, muons are most likely to succeed in establishing the connection between broken symmetries in the standard model of particle physics and that found in living organisms. We calculate the radiation doses deposited by primary and secondary cosmic rays at various prime targets for the searches of life in the solar system: Mars, Venus, Titan, icy moons and planetesimals, and discuss the implications for the enantioselective mutagenesis proposed as to be the driver of homochiralization. Earth is unusual in that spin-polarized muons dominate the cosmic radiation at its surface.",

      "abstract": "Low-mass stars show evidence of vigorous magnetic activity in the form of large flares and coronal mass ejections. Such space weather events may have important ramifications for the habitability and observational fingerprints of exoplanetary atmospheres. Here, using a suite of three-dimensional coupled chemistry-climate model simulations, we explore effects of time-dependent stellar activity on rocky planet atmospheres orbiting G, K and M dwarf stars. We employ observed data from the MUSCLES campaign and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and test a range of rotation period, magnetic field strength and flare frequency assumptions. We find that recurring flares drive the atmospheres of planets around K and M dwarfs into chemical equilibria that substantially deviate from their pre-flare regimes, whereas the atmospheres of G dwarf planets quickly return to their baseline states. Interestingly, simulated O<SUB>2</SUB>-poor and O<SUB>2</SUB>-rich atmospheres experiencing flares produce similar mesospheric nitric oxide abundances, suggesting that stellar flares can highlight otherwise undetectable chemical species. Applying a radiative transfer model to our chemistry-climate model results, we find that flare-driven transmission features of bio-indicating chemical species, such as nitrogen dioxide, nitrous oxide and nitric acid, show particular promise for detection by future instruments.",

      "abstract": "Solar Proton Events (SPEs) can cause abrupt and significant enhancements to the Martian surface radiation dose. Observations of the impact of SPEs on the Martian surface are available from satellites and surface detectors, but the data set is very limited in time, and the energy range is limited in scope, which makes it insufficient to estimate the impact of major events on the Martian surface. On the other hand, long-term data of SPEs impacting the Earth spanning a large energy range is widely available, and can be used to estimate the impact of major events on Mars on long timescales. Herein, we take major SPEs observed during the past several decades on Earth (1956 - 2014), along with PAMELA observations (2006 - 2014) and use the GEANT4 Monte Carlo code to calculate the Martian surface radiation dose. We study the contribution of proton fluence and spectral shape of events on the surface radiation dose and estimated the impact of possible major SPEs on the Martian surface in the future. These results have major implications for the planned human exploration of Mars. Overall we find that the radiation dose from extreme events can have a significant impact on astronaut health, and in rare, worst case scenarios, the estimated dose can even reach lethal levels.",

      "abstract": "Cosmic rays may have contributed to the start of life on the Earth. Here, we investigate the evolution of the Galactic cosmic ray spectrum at the Earth from ages t = 0.6-6.0 Gyr. We use a 1D cosmic ray transport model and a 1.5D stellar wind model to derive the evolving wind properties of a solar-type star. At $t=1\\,$ Gyr, approximately when life is thought to have begun on the Earth, we find that the intensity of \u223cGeV Galactic cosmic rays would have been \u223c10 times smaller than the present-day value. At lower kinetic energies, Galactic cosmic ray modulation would have been even more severe. More generally, we find that the differential intensity of low-energy Galactic cosmic rays decreases at younger ages and is well described by a broken power law in solar rotation rate. We provide an analytic formula of our Galactic cosmic ray spectra at the Earth's orbit for different ages. Our model is also applicable to other solar-type stars with exoplanets orbiting at different radii. Specifically, we use our Galactic cosmic ray spectrum at 20 au for $t=600\\,$ Myr to estimate the penetration of cosmic rays in the atmosphere of HR 2562b, a directly imaged exoplanet orbiting a young solar-type star. We find that the majority of particles &lt;0.1 GeV are attenuated at pressures \u227310<SUP>-5</SUP> bar and thus do not reach altitudes below \u223c100 km. Observationally constraining the Galactic cosmic ray spectrum in the atmosphere of a warm Jupiter would in turn help constrain the flux of cosmic rays reaching young Earth-like exoplanets.",

This is the classical problem that has been firstly studied in 1970 by Baranov et al. [1] under the thin layer approximation. <P />In this paper we present results of numerical solutions obtained with high spatial resolution of the numerical grid. The computations were performed by using GPU processors with high-performance parallel programming technology CUDA from NVIDIA. It is shown that the stationary solution depends only on two dimensionless parameters - Mach number in the interstellar medium, M<SUB>\u221e</SUB>, and adiabatic index, \u03b3. The stationary solutions were obtained for different values of M<SUB>\u221e</SUB> for low and medium resolution of the numerical grids. For the numerical grids of high spatial resolution the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability appears at the tangential discontinuities (both primary and secondary) in the tail part of interaction region. The instability is convective as it should be according to the linear analyses by Ruderman et al. [6]. We explore the instability evolution with increasing resolution of the numerical grid. Effects of the numerical scheme are also studied.",

      "abstract": "Context. Ultra-low frequency observations (&lt; 100 MHz) are particularly challenging because they are usually performed in a low signal-to-noise ratio regime due to the high sky temperature and because of ionospheric disturbances whose effects are inversely proportional to the observing frequency. Nonetheless, these observations are crucial for studying the emission from low-energy populations of cosmic rays. <BR /> Aims: We aim to obtain the first thermal-noise limited (\u223c1.5 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>) deep continuum radio map using the Low Frequency Array's Low Band Antenna (LOFAR LBA) system. Our demonstration observation targeted the galaxy cluster RX J0603.3+4214 (known as the Toothbrush cluster). We used the resulting ultra-low frequency (39-78 MHz) image to study cosmic-ray acceleration and evolution in the post shock region considering the presence of a radio halo. <BR /> Methods: We describe the data reduction we used to calibrate LOFAR LBA observations. The resulting image was combined with observations at higher frequencies (LOFAR 150 MHz and VLA 1500 MHz) to extract spectral information. <BR /> Results: We obtained the first thermal-noise limited image from an observation carried out with the LOFAR LBA system using all Dutch stations at a central frequency of 58 MHz. With eight hours of data, we reached an rms noise of 1.3 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP> at a resolution of 18\u2033 \u00d7 11\u2033. <BR /> Conclusions: The procedure we developed is an important step towards routine high-fidelity imaging with the LOFAR LBA. The analysis of the radio spectra shows that the radio relic extends to distances of 800 kpc downstream from the shock front, larger than what is allowed by electron cooling time. Furthermore, the shock wave started accelerating electrons already at a projected distance of &lt; 300 kpc from the crossing point of the two clusters. These results may be explained by electrons being re-accelerated downstream by background turbulence, possibly combined with projection effects with respect to the radio halo. <P />The reduced images are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/642/A85\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/642/A85</A>",

      "abstract": "The habitability of the surface of any planet is determined by a complex evolution of its interior, surface, and atmosphere. The electromagnetic and particle radiation of stars drive thermal, chemical, and physical alteration of planetary atmospheres, including escape. Many known extrasolar planets experience vastly different stellar environments than those in our solar system: It is crucial to understand the broad range of processes that lead to atmospheric escape and evolution under a wide range of conditions if we are to assess the habitability of worlds around other stars. One problem encountered between the planetary and the astrophysics communities is a lack of common language for describing escape processes. Each community has customary approximations that may be questioned by the other, such as the hypothesis of H-dominated thermosphere for astrophysicists or the Sun-like nature of the stars for planetary scientists. Since exoplanets are becoming one of the main targets for the detection of life, a common set of definitions and hypotheses are required. We review the different escape mechanisms proposed for the evolution of planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres. We propose a common definition for the different escape mechanisms, and we show the important parameters to take into account when evaluating the escape at a planet in time. We show that the paradigm of the magnetic field as an atmospheric shield should be changed and that recent work on the history of Xenon in Earth's atmosphere gives an elegant explanation to its enrichment in heavier isotopes: the so-called Xenon paradox.",

      "abstract": "Multiple properties of the solar wind that affect the earth are summarized in this overview. 13 specific solar-wind parameters that influence geomagnetic activity, the plasma sheet, the ionosphere, and the electron radiation belt are catalogued: these include the wind speed, number density, magnetic-field strength, field orientation, Mach number, Alfven speed, electron-strahl intensity, and magnetic-field fluctuation amplitude. The solar wind at Earth is categorized into four types of plasma emanating from different morphological features on the solar surface and the systematic differences between the four plasma types is assessed. The solar-cycle behavior of the solar wind is examined in terms of the changing occurrence rates of the four plasma types emanating from the changing Sun. A 27-day periodicity in the properties of the solar wind and in the reaction of the Earth are investigated: the periodicity is owed to features on the rotating Sun. The strong intercorrelations between solar-wind variables are considered and the origins of the intercorrelations are explained. Large-scale structures in the solar wind are reviewed and the different types of geomagnetic storms that they drive are summarized. The mesoscale magnetic structure of the solar wind is examined, the impact on Earth of its current sheets and cellular structure is explored, and a non-randomness in variations of the magnetic-field direction changes at Earth is demonstrated. Sudden strong velocity shears in the solar wind are discussed and their impact on the magnetosphere is shown via a global MHD simulation. The magnetic structure moving outward from the Sun faster than the plasma outflow is discussed, and it is pointed out that the velocity of the magnetic structure should be used when calculating the motional electric field of the Sun. Finally, drawbacks to monitoring the solar wind from L1 are identified.",

      "abstract": "Colorful and dynamic aurora has attracted human's attention since the dawn of time. However, mystery remains in understanding a distinct class of aurora, transpolar auroral arc (TPA) (or \"theta\" aurora) which occurs in extremely high latitude of the Earth polar regions when interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is northward. Previous theories are unable to explain why multiple TPAs often occur. Our comprehensive observations in the ionosphere and magnetotail as well as a three-dimensional magnetosphere modeling shed insight on how multiple TPAs form. Our study offers clues how solar wind energy and mass transfer into the magnetosphere and ionosphere under a northward IMF that occurs nearly half of the time.",

Between October 2017 and January 2019, MMS captured 10 foreshock transient events with burst resolution data that we show are consistent with FBs. One \"textbook\" event is examined and described in detail. Employing the multipoint nature of MMS, we demonstrate how the size and orientation, expansion speed, and distance since formation can be estimated. From all 10 events, FB sizes ranged from 1.1 to 9.9 R<SUB>E</SUB> (average of 4.4 R<SUB>E</SUB>), and expansion speeds ranged from 139 to 377 km/s (average of 257 km/s). FBs formed under a usual range of solar wind conditions between 3 and 20 R<SUB>E</SUB> upstream of Earth's bow shock. We also report on new features of FBs: deep and localized magnetic \"holes\" within the cores of FBs, where the total field strength drops to &lt;1 nT.",

      "abstract": "Explosive magnetotail activity has long been understood in the context of its auroral manifestations. While global models have been used to interpret and understand many magnetospheric processes, the temporal and spatial scales of some auroral forms have been inaccessible to global modeling creating a gulf between observational and theoretical studies of these phenomena. We present here an important step toward bridging this gulf using a newly developed global magnetosphere-ionosphere model with resolution capturing \u2272 30 km azimuthal scales in the auroral zone. In a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the growth phase of a synthetic substorm, we find the self-consistent formation and destabilization of localized magnetic field minima in the near-Earth magnetotail. We demonstrate that this destabilization is due to ballooning-interchange instability which drives earthward entropy bubbles with embedded magnetic fronts. Finally, we show that these bubbles create localized field-aligned current structures that manifest in the ionosphere with properties matching observed auroral beads.",

      "abstract": "We present multiepoch infrared photometry and spectroscopy obtained with warm Spitzer, Subaru, and the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy to assess variability for the young (\u223c20 Myr) and dusty debris systems around HD 172555 and HD 113766A. No variations (within 0.5%) were found for the former at either 3.6 or 4.5 \u03bcm, while significant nonperiodic variations (peak to peak of \u223c10%-15% relative to the primary star) were detected for the latter. Relative to the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph spectra taken in 2004, multiepoch mid-infrared spectra reveal no change in either the shape of the prominent 10 \u03bcm solid-state features or the overall flux levels (no more than 20%) for both systems, corroborating the fact that the population of submicron-size grains that produce the pronounced solid-state features is stable over a decadal timescale. We suggest that these submicron-size grains were initially generated in an optically thick clump of debris of millimeter-size vapor condensates resulting from a recent violent impact between large asteroidal or planetary bodies. Because of the shielding from the stellar photons provided by this clump, intense collisions led to an overproduction of fine grains that would otherwise be ejected from the system by radiation pressure. As the clump is sheared by its orbital motion and becomes optically thin, a population of very fine grains could remain in stable orbits until Poynting-Robertson drag slowly spirals them into the star. We further suggest that the 3-5 \u03bcm disk variation around HD 113766A is consistent with a clump/arc of such fine grains on a modestly eccentric orbit in its terrestrial zone.",

      "abstract": "With upcoming missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope, the European Extremely Large Telescope, and the Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey, we soon will be on the verge of detecting and characterizing Earth-like exoplanetary atmospheres for the first time. These planets are most likely to be found around smaller and cooler K- and M-type stars. However, recent observations showed that their radiation environment might be much harsher than that of the Sun. Thus, the exoplanets are most likely exposed to an enhanced stellar radiation environment, which could affect their habitability, for example, in the form of a hazardous flux of energetic particles. Knowing the stellar radiation field, and being able to model the radiation exposure on the surface of a planet, is crucial to assess its habitability. In this study, we present 3D magnetohydrodynamic-based model efforts investigating M-stars, focusing on V374 Peg, Proxima Centauri, and LHS 1140, chosen because of their diverse astrospheric quantities. We show that V374 Peg has a much larger astrosphere (ASP) than our Sun, while Proxima Centauri and LHS 1140 most likely have ASPs comparable to or even much smaller than the heliosphere, respectively. Based on a 1D transport model, for the first time, we provide numerical estimates of the modulation of Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) within the three ASPs. We show that the impact of GCRs on the Earth-like exoplanets Proxima Centauri b and LHS 1140 b cannot be neglected in the context of exoplanetary habitability.",

We find that for the particular parameters used in our study, the stellar wind conditions near the planet are not very extreme\u2014slightly stronger than that near the Earth in terms of the stellar wind ram pressure and the intensity of the interplanetary magnetic field. Thus, the space environment near TOI 700 d may not be extremely harmful to the planetary atmosphere, assuming the planet resembles the Earth. Nevertheless, we stress that the stellar input parameters and the actual planetary parameters are unconstrained, and different parameters may result in a much greater effect on the atmosphere of TOI 700 d. Finally, we compare our results to solar wind measurements in the solar system and stress that modest stellar wind conditions may not guarantee atmospheric retention of exoplanets.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\u2014For the case of the sub-Alfv\u00e9n regime of the stellar wind flyby around the planet, the flow structure in the vicinity of a hot Jupiter have been studied by three-dimensional numerical simulation. As an example, the hot Jupiter HD 209458b was considered. The planet's magnetic moment was set equal to 10% of the magnetic moment of Jupiter. The average magnetic field at the parent star's surface was taken to be 0.5 G, corresponding to a relatively strong wind field. Under such conditions, calculations have shown that a quasi-closed ionospheric (gas) envelope with an induced shockless magnetosphere forms around a hot Jupiter. Under the influence of the strong magnetic field of stellar wind, envelope matter outflowing from the inner Lagrange point does not move along the ballistic trajectory, but rather moves along magnetic field lines of the wind toward the star. Therefore, for the sub-Alfv\u00e9n flow regime, a new ionospheric envelope type of hot Jupiters is considered to be discovered, supplementing the classification suggested earlier based on results of purely gas-dynamic modeling. Possible distinctive features of the observational manifestations of such envelopes are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Context. The discovery of Proxima b marked one of the most important milestones in exoplanetary science in recent years. Yet the limited precision of the available radial velocity data and the difficulty in modelling the stellar activity calls for a confirmation of the Earth-mass planet. <BR /> Aims: We aim to confirm the presence of Proxima b using independent measurements obtained with the new ESPRESSO spectrograph, and refine the planetary parameters taking advantage of its improved precision. <BR /> Methods: We analysed 63 spectroscopic ESPRESSO observations of Proxima (Gl 551) taken during 2019. We obtained radial velocity measurements with a typical radial velocity photon noise of 26 cm s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We combined these data with archival spectroscopic observations and newly obtained photometric measurements to model the stellar activity signals and disentangle them from planetary signals in the radial velocity (RV) data. We ran a joint Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis on the time series of the RV and full width half maximum of the cross-correlation function to model the planetary and stellar signals present in the data, applying Gaussian process regression to deal with the stellar activity signals. <BR /> Results: We confirm the presence of Proxima b independently in the ESPRESSO data and in the combined ESPRESSO+ HARPS+UVES dataset. The ESPRESSO data on its own shows Proxima b at a period of 11.218 \u00b1 0.029 days, with a minimum mass of 1.29 \u00b1 0.13 M<SUB>\u2295</SUB>. In the combined dataset we measure a period of 11.18427 \u00b1 0.00070 days with a minimum mass of 1.173 \u00b1 0.086 M<SUB>\u2295</SUB>. We get a clear measurement of the stellar rotation period (87 \u00b1 12 d) and its induced RV signal, but no evidence of stellar activity as a potential cause for the 11.2 days signal. We find some evidence for the presence of a second short-period signal, at 5.15 days with a semi-amplitude of only 40 cm s<SUP>-1</SUP>. If caused by a planetary companion, it would correspond to a minimum mass of 0.29 \u00b1 0.08 M<SUB>\u2295</SUB>. We find that forthe case of Proxima, the full width half maximum of the cross-correlation function can be used as a proxy for the brightness changes and that its gradient with time can be used to successfully detrend the RV data from part of the influence of stellar activity. The activity-induced RV signal in the ESPRESSO data shows a trend in amplitude towards redder wavelengths. Velocities measured using the red end of the spectrograph are less affected by activity, suggesting that the stellar activity is spot dominated. This could be used to create differential RVs that are activity dominated and can be used to disentangle activity-induced and planetary-induced signals. The data collected excludes the presence of extra companions with masses above 0.6 M<SUB>\u2295</SUB> at periods shorter than 50 days. <P />The data used in this paper are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/639/A77\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/639/A77</A> <P />Based [in part] on Guaranteed Time Observations collected at the European Southern Observatory under ESO programme 1102.C-0744. by the ESPRESSO Consortium. <P />This work makes use of observations from the LCOGT network.",

      "abstract": "We present a statistical investigation of the effects of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) on hemispheric asymmetry in auroral currents. Nearly 6 years of magnetic field measurements from Swarm A and C satellites are analyzed. Bootstrap resampling is used to remove the difference in the number of samples and IMF conditions between the local seasons and the hemispheres. Currents are stronger in Northern Hemisphere (NH) than Southern Hemisphere (SH) for IMF By<SUP>+</SUP> in NH (By<SUP>-</SUP> in SH) in most local seasons under both signs of IMF Bz. For By<SUP>-</SUP> in NH (By<SUP>+</SUP> in SH), the hemispheric difference in currents is small except in local winter when currents in NH are stronger than in SH. During By<SUP>+</SUP> and Bz<SUP>+</SUP> in NH (By<SUP>-</SUP> and Bz<SUP>+</SUP> in SH), the largest hemispheric asymmetry occurs in local winter and autumn, when the NH/SH ratio of field aligned current (FAC) is 1.18 \u00b1 0.09 in winter and 1.17 \u00b1 0.09 in autumn. During By<SUP>+</SUP> and Bz<SUP>-</SUP> in NH (By<SUP>-</SUP> and Bz<SUP>-</SUP> in SH), the largest asymmetry is observed in local autumn with NH/SH ratio of 1.16 \u00b1 0.07 for FAC. We also find an explicit By effect on auroral currents in a given hemisphere: on average By<SUP>+</SUP> in NH and By<SUP>-</SUP> in SH causes larger currents than vice versa. The explicit By effect on divergence-free current during IMF Bz<SUP>+</SUP> is in very good agreement with the By effect on the cross polar cap potential from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network dynamic model except at SH equinox and NH summer.",

Conjugate comparisons from \u223c850 km reveal more quasi-static PF arriving in the northern hemisphere (NH) than the southern hemisphere (SH). This tendency is clear in the dawn-dusk sectors and during intervals when Kp &lt; 3, which accounts for \u223c80% of the study interval. Summer-to-summer comparisons indicate this asymmetry is partially associated with more NH solar illumination, which supports stronger NH field-aligned currents (FAC). Differing hemispheric FAC configurations may also play a role. Our findings support and broaden earlier reports of similar NH preference for the deposition of Alfvenic PF. Regionally the NH has stronger dusk-region PF, while the SH has stronger mid-morning PF. We find PF deposition in the near-cusp regions that rivals and often exceeds the PF intensity in the auroral zones.",

      "abstract": "Taking advantage of the high spatial resolution and global coverage of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager observations, we investigated the critical interplanetary factors in controlling the cusp auroral emission by dividing the midday auroras into the gap (weak emission) and non gap (intense emission) events. Although the cusp auroral intensity is essentially determined by a parameter related to the IMF (interplanetary magnetic field) direction, IMF magnitude (|B<SUB>y</SUB>|), and solar wind speed (V), we found that the cusp aurora is statistically weak during the southward IMF but intense when the V and IMF |B<SUB>y</SUB>| are greater. Further, we confirmed that even with V &gt; 600 km/s, the intense aurora event still shows a minimum occurrence near the IMF |B<SUB>y</SUB>| = 0. However, when the IMF |B<SUB>y</SUB>| is greater, the V becomes less significant for the intense aurora occurrence. These results demonstrate that the IMF |B<SUB>y</SUB>| is critical in controlling the cusp auroral intensity, most likely by producing an electric field which is given as V\u00d7By.",

      "abstract": "Unlike the nightside aurora, which is controlled mainly by magnetic field reconnection in the magnetotail, the dayside aurora is closely associated with magnetic field merging at the dayside magnetopause. About two decades ago, it was discovered that the aurora is also controlled by solar insolation. Because the finding was based on data acquired mainly in the Northern Hemisphere, an outstanding question is if the auroral solar insolation effect also exists in the Southern Hemisphere. The present study addresses this question by studying dayside auroras from both hemispheres. We analyze 6 years' worth of Earth disk emissions at far ultraviolet wavelengths acquired by the Global UltraViolet Imager on-board the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics satellite from 2002 to 2007. It is found that the solar insolation effect also exists in the Southern Hemisphere. In essence, the energy flux deposited as electron precipitation, is larger when the polar hemisphere is sunlit and is smaller when the polar hemisphere is dark. Because auroras are produced mainly by electron precipitation and because electrons are the main current carrier, this north-south asymmetry is consistent with the previous finding that larger (smaller) field-aligned currents are flowing out of the sunlit (dark) hemisphere. This trend is independent of the solar wind driving, suggesting that it is an effect associated with solar insolation. A small north-south asymmetry in the dayside auroral energy flux was identified. We discuss the asymmetry in the context of magnetospheric current and voltage generators.",

      "abstract": "We track a remarkably bright and persistent auroral cusp spot emission in the high-latitude Northern Hemisphere polar cap, well inside the main auroral oval, for approximately 11 hr on 16 and 17 June 2012. The auroral emissions are presented in both the Lyman-\u03b1 and Lyman-Birge-Hopfield bands, as observed by the Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager on board two of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Programme spacecraft, and supported by detections of precipitating particles by the same spacecraft. The auroral observations are accompanied by patterns of field aligned currents, obtained from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment, along with ionospheric convection patterns from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network. These data provide unprecedented coverage of a cusp spot, unusually seen in both electron and proton aurora. The location and movement of the auroral emissions, current systems, and ionospheric convection patterns are extremely distorted under the northward to Y-component-dominated interplanetary magnetic field. The cusp spot emission region is associated with the sunward flow region of the ionosphere. Ion dispersion signatures are detected on traversal of the region of brightest proton auroral emissions. Proton-excited Lyman-\u03b1 emissions are most evident following impulses of high solar wind density. The auroral emissions, field-aligned current patterns, and ionospheric convection are consistent with a model of a compressed magnetosphere under strongly northward interplanetary magnetic field, following an impact of an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection and associated magnetic cloud at the magnetopause, inducing high-latitude lobe reconnection that progresses increasingly tailward during the presented interval.",

      "abstract": "A new empirical model of field-aligned currents in the Earth's ionosphere has been developed. This model is derived using magnetometer data from the CHAallenging Minisatellite Payload, \u00d8 rsted, and Swarm satellite missions, which has created a database that spans more than 15 years. These data have been associated with solar wind conditions using the Advanced Composition Explorer satellite, as well as the F10.7, S10.7, M10.7, and Y10.7 solar indices. With the wealth of data and associated driving conditions, this model has been developed to reproduce field-aligned current maps of the ionosphere based on solar wind electric field, interplanetary magnetic field clock angle, dipole tilt angle, solar index, and geographic hemisphere. This model was constructed using a series of spherical cap harmonic analysis fits based on small selections of the overall database. The coefficients of these fits were then used to develop a model that would reproduce these coefficients based on the previously described driving conditions. One of the most notable improvements demonstrated by this model is the ability to show distinct current regions in the ionosphere, particularly with respect to Region 0 currents during northward Bz and highly positive or negative By.",

      "abstract": "The Moon interacts with the incident solar wind plasma in various ways, and most of these interactions are accompanied by variations of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) around the Moon. Here we first report decreases of the IMF strength observed at 100 km altitude on the lunar dayside and over the polar region, comparing upstream solar wind data from ACE with Kaguya (SELENE) data. We note that the magnetic field decreases are observed above non-magnetized regions or very weakly magnetized regions. In one event the IMF is weakened in the dayside northern hemisphere when the IMF is roughly anti-parallel to the solar wind flow. We estimate that the decrease in the magnetic pressure can be partly compensated by the thermal pressure of the back-scattered solar wind protons, which suggests that the magnetic field decrease is interpreted as diamagnetic effect by the back-scattered protons. In another event an IMF decrease is continuously detected from the northern polar region to the dayside mid-latitude region, which is not fully explained by the thermal pressure of the back-scattered protons. We also discuss the diamagnetic current system in the upstream (fore-moon) solar wind region formed by the back-scattered protons.",

      "abstract": "On the equatorward side of the dayside cusp there often appear diffuse auroras. In this paper, we report north-south aligned discrete aurora events and show the spatial relationships between the auroras and the plasma flow. Several events of the north-south aligned discrete auroral structures were identified using an all-sky imager at Longyearbyen, Svalbard, during the recovery of a moderately disturbed period on 8 December 2013. During a brief interval of the moderately disturbed period, the cusp shifted to higher latitudes; as a result, the field-aligned beam of the EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR) passed through the northern portion of the north-south aligned auroral structures. Simultaneous observations from the all-sky imager and ESR reveal that enhancements in ion temperature (caused by fast ion flow) occurred near the eastward and westward boundaries of the north-south aligned auroral structures. However, within the region of the most enhanced aurora, the ion temperature enhancements were moderately suppressed. These features indicate that the ion flow slows down in the region of electron precipitation responsible for north-south aligned auroral structures. We can quantitatively interpret the slowdown of the flow as the reduction of the electric field due to the polarization effect in the north-south aligned region of the increased Pedersen conductivity. It thus appears that the magnetospheric source of the north-south aligned discrete auroras is a limited area embedded in the region of plasma flow toward the dayside magnetopause.",

      "abstract": "A dawn-dusk asymmetry in many high-latitude ionospheric and magnetospheric phenomena, including the aurora, can be linked to the east-west ( y) component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Owing to the scarcity of observations in the Southern Hemisphere, most of the previous findings are associated with the Northern Hemisphere. It has long been suspected that if the IMF B <SUB> y </SUB> component also produces a dawn-dusk asymmetry and/or a mirror image in the Southern Hemisphere as predicted by some theories. The present study explores the effect of the IMF B <SUB> y </SUB> component on the dayside aurora from both hemispheres by analyzing the auroral emission data from the Global UltraViolet scanning spectrograph Imager on board the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics mission spacecraft from 2002 to 2007. The data set comprises 28,774 partial images of the northern hemispheric oval and 29,742 partial images of the southern hemispheric oval, allowing for a statistical analysis. It is found that even though auroras in different regions of the dayside oval respond differently to the orientation of the IMF B <SUB> y </SUB> component, their responses are opposite between the two hemispheres. For example, at 1400-1600 MLT in the Northern Hemisphere, where the so-called 1500 MLT auroral hot spots occur, peak auroral energy flux is larger for negative IMF B <SUB> y </SUB> comparing to positive IMF B <SUB> y </SUB>. The response is reversed in the Southern Hemisphere. The present study also suggests that the total energy flux does not change with the IMF B <SUB> y </SUB> orientation change. This result is consistent with a larger (smaller) convection vortex in the postnoon sector for IMF B <SUB> y </SUB> &lt; 0 ( B <SUB> y </SUB> &gt; 0) resulting from anti-parallel merging.",

      "abstract": "The refilling of the lunar wake is relatively well explained by the theory of 1-D plasma expansion into a vacuum; however, the field-aligned wake potential is not a directly measured quantity, and thus, a statistical analysis of wake potentials at high altitudes has not been previously performed. In this study, we obtain the wake potential by comparing the field-aligned electron distributions inside and outside of the lunar wake measured by the two probes of the Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of Moon's Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) mission. The derived potentials from ARTEMIS data vary with solar wind electron temperature and bulk flow velocity as the theory predicts. We also expand the 1-D plasma theory to 2-D in the plane of the interplanetary magnetic field and the solar wind velocity to examine how a tilted interplanetary magnetic field affects the wake potential structure. As the expansion time for the two sides of the wake differs, a wake potential asymmetry is developed in our model. This asymmetry is confirmed by the data-derived wake potentials. Moreover, ambipolar electric fields are obtained from both the modeled and data-derived wake potentials and show good agreement. Lastly, we examine the effects of the solar wind strahl-electron population on the wake potential structure, which appears to cause a net potential difference across the lunar shadow. This may imply that the disturbance of the wake plasma expansion extends farther outside the wake than previous plasma-expansion theories have predicted.",

      "abstract": "Magnetosheath high-speed jets (HSJs) are dayside upstream transient disturbances with enhanced flow velocity and dynamic pressure. They are associated with significant magnetopause perturbations, ultralow frequency waves in the dayside magnetosphere, and localized flow enhancements in the ionosphere. However, whether HSJs have corresponding dayside aurora signatures is still an open question. If auroral signatures are found, 2-D structure and evolution of HSJ effects on the magnetosphere can be imaged in a much higher precision than possible by other means. In this study, eight HSJ events are identified by the THEMIS satellites located within \u00b11 MLT of the center of the field-of-view of the South Pole station all-sky imager. In all of those cases, the HSJs are observed to have a nearly one-to-one relationship with individual localized discrete/diffuse auroral brightenings. The azimuthal size of HSJ-related diffuse aurora signatures is 800 km at 230-km altitude in the ionosphere and 3.7 Re in the magnetosphere, which is slightly larger but of the order of the cross-sectional diameter of HSJs ( 1 Re). Furthermore, most of those aurora signatures have azimuthal motion, whose magnitude and direction agree with magnetosheath background flows. This study for the first time shows high-resolution, two-dimensional observations of localized structure and fast propagation of precipitation due to magnetosheath HSJs. We conclude that magnetosheath HSJs can have substantial impacts on the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system, causing localized magnetospheric compression and aurora brightening, in a similar manner to responses during interplanetary shocks except with a smaller scale size.",

      "abstract": "Observed delays in the ground response to solar wind directional discontinuities have been explained as the result of larger than expected magnetosheath propagation times. Recently, Samsonov et al. (2017, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL075020\">https://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL075020</A>) showed that the typical time for a southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) turning to propagate across the magnetosheath is 14 min. Here by using a combination of magnetohydrodynamic simulations, spacecraft observations, and analytic calculations, we study the dependence of the propagation time on solar wind parameters and near-magnetopause cutoff speed. Increases in the solar wind speed result in greater magnetosheath plasma flow velocities, decreases in the magnetosheath thickness and, as a result, decreases in the propagation time. Increases in the IMF strength result in increases in the magnetosheath thickness and increases in the propagation time. Both magnetohydrodynamic simulations and observations suggest that propagation times are slightly smaller for northward IMF turnings. Magnetosheath flow deceleration must be taken into account when predicting the arrival times of solar wind structures at the dayside magnetopause.",

Here we present the first in situ measurements suggesting that such an impact triggered magnetopause reconnection. We use observations from the five Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms spacecraft in a string-of-pearls configuration on 7 August 2007. The spacecraft recorded magnetopause in-and-out motion during an impact of a magnetosheath jet (V<SUB>N</SUB>\u223c-300 km/s along the magnetopause normal direction). There was no evidence for reconnection for the preimpact crossing, yet three probes observed reconnection after the impact. We infer that the jet impact compressed the originally thick (60-70 d<SUB>i</SUB>), high magnetic shear (140-160\u00b0 magnetopause until it was thin enough for reconnection to occur. Magnetosheath high-speed jets could therefore act as a driver for bursty dayside reconnection.",

      "abstract": "Flux transfer events are bursts of reconnection at the dayside magnetopause, which give rise to characteristic signatures observed by a range of magnetospheric/ionospheric instrumentation. One outstanding problem is that there is a fundamental mismatch between space-based and ionospheric estimates of the flux that is opened by each flux transfer event\u2014in other words, their overall significance in the Dungey cycle. Spacecraft-based estimates of the flux content of individual flux transfer events (FTEs) correspond to each event transferring flux equivalent to approximately 1% of the open flux in the magnetosphere, whereas studies based on global-scale radar and auroral observations suggest this figure could be of the order of 10%. In the former case, flux transfer events would be a minor detail in the Dungey cycle, but in the latter they could be its main driver. We present observations of two conjunctions between flux transfer events observed by the Cluster spacecraft and pulsed ionospheric flows observed by the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) network. In both cases, a similar number of FTE signatures were observed by Cluster and one of the SuperDARN radars, but the conjunctions differ in the azimuthal separation of the spacecraft and ionospheric observations (i.e., the distance of the spacecraft from the cusp throat). We argue that the reason for the existing mismatch in flux estimates is due to implicit assumptions made about FTE structure, which tacitly ignore the majority of flux opened in mechanisms based on longer reconnection lines. If the effects of such mechanisms are considered, a much better match is found.",

For each \u03d5<SUB>IMF</SUB> orientation we compare IAW Poynting flux and IAW-associated electron energy flux distributions with previously published distributions of Alfv\u00e9nic Poynting flux over \u223c2-22 mHz, as well as corresponding wave-driven electron energy deposition derived from Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry global MHD simulations. We also compare IAW Poynting flux distributions with distributions of broad and diffuse electron number flux, categorized using an adaptation of the Newell et al.

Under negative IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> in the vicinity of the cusp (9.5-14.5 magnetic local time), regions of intense dayside IAW power correspond to enhanced diffuse electron number flux but relatively weaker broadband electron precipitation. Differences between cusp region IAW activity and broadband precipitation illustrate the need for additional information, such as fields or pitch angle measurements, to identify the physical mechanisms associated with electron precipitation in the vicinity of the cusp.",

      "abstract": "We use the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms data to investigate the magnetic field structure just outside the magnetopause and its time evolution for radial interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) events. When the magnetic field drapes around the magnetopause in the magnetosheath region, an asymmetric magnetic field orientation in different hemispheres is expected. Our two-case study reveals some conflicts with the predicted draped field configuration in the Southern Hemisphere. The magnetosheath B<SUB>z</SUB> component had a different sign depending on the upstream IMF B<SUB>x</SUB> component's polarity at the beginning of the radial IMF intervals. With time, the observed B<SUB>z</SUB> became northward in both cases with increasing positive values through the events. The increasing value of the B<SUB>z</SUB> component may be explained by two possible mechanisms: by a change of the upstream IMF and by a reconnection between magnetosheath and magnetospheric field lines. Our study shows that both mechanisms contributed to the observed changes. Thus, there was a correlation between the change of the upstream IMF conditions and an increase in the magnetosheath northward magnetic field component. The observed formation of the boundary layer near the magnetopause proves that the reconnection process was ongoing at least for a part of the time. We suggest two possible reconnection scenarios: one near subsolar point and another tailward of the one cusp due to lobe reconnection. The asymmetry of reconnection locations causes rearrangement of the magnetic field structure near the magnetopause and turns the observed magnetosheath B<SUB>z</SUB> component even further into positive values.",

Observations from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) over the three years 2010 to 2012 are employed to illustrate the variability of the field-aligned currents that couple the magnetosphere and ionosphere, on timescales from minutes to years, in response to the impact of solar wind disturbances on the magnetosphere and changes in the level of solar illumination of the polar ionospheres. The variability is discussed within the context of the occurrence of magnetic reconnection between the solar wind and terrestrial magnetic fields at the magnetopause, the transport of magnetic flux within the magnetosphere, and the onset of magnetic reconnection in the magnetotail. The conditions under which the currents are expected to be weak, and hence minimally contaminate measurements of the internally-produced magnetic field of the Earth, are briefly outlined.",

      "abstract": "Auroral emission at a wavelength of 630.0 nm (red line) has a long radiative time. In this study, we show how this long radiative time controls the horizontal extent of a moving mesoscale aurora, which is typical of the cusp. Using high time resolution (4 s) observations by an all-sky imager at Longyearbyen, Svalbard, and observations by the European Incoherent Scatter Svalbard Radar (ESR), we examined the auroral emission enhancements obtained in the cusp during an interval of southward interplanetary magnetic field on 27 November 2011. Simultaneous observations from the all-sky imager and the ESR clearly show the manner in which auroral emission regions passed through the radar's field of view. When the front edge of the moving auroral structure intersected the radar's field of view, the ESR electron temperature was enhanced. A few minutes later, the ESR electron temperature dropped to the background level, indicating that the mesoscale electron precipitation region shifted away from the radar's field of view. At that time, the auroral emission in the radar's field of view decreased but still had adequate intensities. These results provide evidence demonstrating that moving cusp auroral emission occurs behind the electron precipitation region as well as inside that region. We interpreted this feature semiquantitatively by using the equation of continuity of the density of the excited atomic oxygen. Our model indicates that the maximum intensity in the moving auroral structure occurs at a point along the trailing edge of the electron precipitation region and that the velocity of that region is important for determining how the 630.0 nm aurora emissions extend horizontally.",

      "abstract": "Observational properties of throat aurora are investigated in detail by using 7 year continuous auroral observations obtained at Yellow River Station (magnetic latitude 76.24\u00b0N). From our inspection, throat aurora is often observed under the condition of stripy diffuse aurora contacting with the persistent discrete auroral oval, and the long-period throat aurora observations generally consist of intermittent subsequences of throat aurora brightening followed by poleward moving auroral form and throat aurora dimming. We also noticed that the orientation of throat aurora is aligned along the ionospheric convection flow, and its local time distribution shows clear dependence on the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) B<SUB>y</SUB> component. These observational results indicate that factors inside the magnetosphere may play important role on occurrence of throat aurora. We thus suggest that throat aurora may present the ionospheric signature of redistribution of reconnection rate on the magnetopause by cold magnetospheric plasma flowing into the reconnection site. In addition, we also found that the occurrence rate of throat aurora clearly decreases with increase of the IMF cone angle (arccos(|B<SUB>x</SUB>|/B)), which is very similar with the occurrence rate of high-speed jet (HSJ) observed in magnetosheath depending on the IMF cone angle. This is suggested as that the HSJs occurred outside the magnetosphere may also play important role for generation of throat aurora by triggering magnetopause reconnection or by direct impacting. Although further studies are needed to clarify how the throat auroras are generated in detail, the relevant observations about throat aurora have presented important implications on a variety open questions, such as distribution and generation of cold plasma structures in the outer magnetosphere, magnetopause deformation, and possible relation between HSJ and reconnection.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that there is a correlation between the B<SUB>y</SUB> component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and the B<SUB>y</SUB> component observed in the magnetotail lobe and in the plasma sheet. However, studies of the effect of IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> on several magnetospheric processes have indicated that the B<SUB>y</SUB> component in the tail should depend more strongly on the recent history of the IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> rather than on the simultaneous measurements of the IMF. Estimates of this timescale vary from \u223c25 min to \u223c4 h. We present a statistical study of how promptly the IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> component is transferred into the neutral sheet, based on Cluster observations of the neutral sheet from 2001 to 2008, and solar wind data from the OMNI database. Five thousand nine hundred eighty-two neutral sheet crossings during this interval were identified, and starting with the correlation between instantaneous measurements of the IMF and the magnetotail (recently reported by Cao et al. (2014)), we vary the time delay applied to the solar wind data. Our results suggest a bimodal distribution with peaks at \u223c1.5 and \u223c3 h. The relative strength of each peak appears to be well controlled by the sign of the IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> component with peaks being observed at 1 h of lag time for southward IMF and up to 5 h for northward IMF conditions, and the magnitude of the solar wind velocity with peaks at 2 h of lag time for fast solar wind and 4 h for slow solar wind conditions.",

      "abstract": "The interaction between the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and the geomagnetic field at the dayside magnetopause leads to transfer of momentum and energy which changes the magnetospheric configuration, but only after a certain time. In this study we quantify this time, to advance our understanding of the causes for the delayed response of the magnetosphere. We study the response and reconfiguration time of the inner magnetosphere to IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> reversals. A superposed epoch analysis of magnetic field measurements from four Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite spacecraft at different local times both for negative to positive IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> reversals and for positive to negative reversals is presented. The magnetospheric response time at geosynchronous orbit to the sudden change of IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> is less than 15 (\u223c10) min from the bow shock (magnetopause) arrival time, while the reconfiguration time is less than 46 (\u223c41) min. These results are consistent with a B<SUB>y</SUB> component induced on closed magnetic field lines due to the asymmetric loading of flux following asymmetric dayside reconnection when IMF B<SUB>y</SUB>\u22600. Our results also confirm our earlier studies that nightside reconnection is not required for generating a B<SUB>y</SUB> component on closed field lines.",

The MVAB-0 scheme is best overall, performing on average a minute more accurately than a flat time-shift. We also evaluate the accuracy of these time-shifting methods as a function of solar wind magnetic field orientation. We find that all time-shifting algorithms perform significantly worse (&gt;5 min) due to geometric effects when the solar wind magnetic field is radial (parallel or antiparallel to the Earth-Sun line). Finally, we present an empirical scheme that performs almost as well as MVAB-0 on average and slightly better than MVAB-0 for intervals with nonradial B.",

      "abstract": "Replacing precious metals in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts has broad prospects to achieve a viable water splitting system. Since the electrocatalytic OER is a four-electron transfer reaction with a very sluggish kinetic process, there is great interest in the development of inexpensive, durable, and high-efficiency OER catalysts. Herein, trimetallic Co-Ni-Ru sulfoselenide and bimetallic sulfoselenide nanosheets were designed by regulating their composition and morphology for efficient and durable OER electrocatalysis. The sheet structure has a large specific surface area to promote contact between the catalyst and electrolyte. Compared with bimetallic Co-Ni, Co-Ru, Ni-Ru, Co-Cd, and Co-Au sulfoselenide nanosheets, trimetallic Co-Ni-Ru sulfoselenide nanosheets show superior OER performance. By modulating the composition ratio of metal atoms in the Co-Ni-Ru-S-Se nanosheets (1:1:0.5:1:1), the nanosheets showed a significant OER overpotential of \u03b7 = 261 mV (1.491 V versus RHE) at 10 mA cm<SUP>\u22122</SUP>, a Tafel slope of 52.2 mV dec<SUP>-1</SUP> and outstanding stability after 48 h of continuous testing. For comparison, Co-Ni, Co-Ru, Ni-Ru, Co-Cd, and Co-Au bimetallic sulfoselenide nanosheets (denoted as Co-Ni-S-Se, Co-Ru-S-Se, Ni-Ru-S-Se, Co-Au-S-Se, Co-Cd-S-Se) were also tested. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that appropriately doping Ru and Ni simultaneously (Co-Ni-Ru-S-Se) can increase the density of the states at the Fermi level, resulting in excellent charge density and low intermediate adsorption energy. These findings present a practical route to design 2D polymetallic nanosheets to optimize catalytic OER performance.",

With the development of the advanced observational, theoretical and numerical methods, there emerges more and more research on the morphology, the kinematic evolution, the prediction of the arrival at 1 AU and the acceleration/deceleration processes of CMEs. Moreover, many direct observations and simulations have revealed that the CMEs may not propagate along a straight trajectory both in the corona and interplanetary space. Both observational and numerical studies have shown that, when two or more CMEs collide with each other, their kinematic characteristics may change significantly. Here, we present a review of the recent progress associated with the different aspects of CMEs, including their interplanetary counterparts ICMEs, especially focusing on the initiation of the CME, the CMEs' propagation characteristics, interaction with the background solar wind structures, the deflection of the CMEs, the interaction between successive CMEs, the particle acceleration associated with successive CMEs' interaction, and the effect of compound events on Earth's magnetosphere.",

      "abstract": "Neumann band in iron meteorites, which is deformation twins in kamacite (Fe-Ni alloy), has been known to be a characteristic texture indicating ancient collisions on parent bodies of meteorites. We conducted a series of shock recovery experiments on bcc iron with the projectile velocity at 1.5 km/s at various initial temperatures, room temperature, 670 K, and 1100 K, and conducted an annealing experiment on the shocked iron. We also conducted numerical simulations with the iSALE-2D code to investigate peak pressure and temperature distributions in the nontransparent targets. The effects of pressure and temperature on the formation and disappearance of the twins (Neumann band) were explored based on laboratory and numerical experiments. The twin was formed in the run products of the experiments conducted at room temperature and 670 K, whereas it was not observed in the run product formed by the impact at 1100 K. The present experiments combined with the numerical simulations revealed that the twin was formed by impacts with various shock pressures from 1.5-2 GPa to around 13 GPa. The twin in iron almost disappeared by annealing at 1070 K. The iron meteorites with Neumann bands were shocked at this pressure range and temperatures at least up to 670 K, and were not heated to the temperatures above 1070 K after the Neumann band formation.",

Our focus is on the largest observed/inferred/theoretical cases of sunspot groups, flares on the Sun and Sun-like stars, coronal mass ejections, solar proton events, and geomagnetic storms. The reviewed studies are based on modern observations, historical or long-term data including the auroral and cosmogenic radionuclide record, and Kepler observations of Sun-like stars. We compile a table of 100- and 1000-year events based on occurrence frequency distributions for the space weather phenomena listed above. Questions considered include the Sun-like nature of superflare stars and the existence of impactful but unpredictable solar \"black swans\" and extreme \"dragon king\" solar phenomena that can involve different physics from that operating in events which are merely large.",

      "abstract": "In this review we focus on the fundamental theory of magnetohydrodynamic reconnection, together with applications to understanding a wide range of dynamic processes in the solar corona, such as flares, jets, coronal mass ejections, the solar wind and coronal heating. We summarise only briefly the related topics of collisionless reconnection, non-thermal particle acceleration, and reconnection in systems other than the corona. We introduce several preliminary topics that are necessary before the subtleties of reconnection can be fully described: these include null points (Sects. 2.1-2.2), other topological and geometrical features such as separatrices, separators and quasi-separatrix layers (Sects. 2.3, 2.6), the conservation of magnetic flux and field lines (Sect. 3), and magnetic helicity (Sect. 4.6). Formation of current sheets in two- and three-dimensional fields is reviewed in Sect. 5. These set the scene for a discussion of the definition and properties of reconnection in three dimensions that covers the conditions for reconnection, the failure of the concept of a flux velocity, the nature of diffusion, and the differences between two-dimensional and three-dimensional reconnection (Sect. 4). Classical 2D models are briefly presented, including magnetic annihilation (Sect. 6), slow and fast regimes of steady reconnection (Sect. 7), and non-steady reconnection such as the tearing mode (Sect. 8). Then three routes to fast reconnection in a collisional or collisionless medium are described (Sect. 9). The remainder of the review is dedicated to our current understanding of how magnetic reconnection operates in three dimensions and in complex magnetic fields such as that of the Sun's corona. In Sects. 10-12, 14.1 the different regimes of reconnection that are possible in three dimensions are summarised, including at a null point, separator, quasi-separator or a braid. The role of 3D reconnection in solar flares (Sect. 13) is reviewed, as well as in coronal heating (Sect. 14), and the release of the solar wind (Sect. 15.2). Extensions including the role of reconnection in the magnetosphere (Sect. 15.3), the link between reconnection and turbulence (Sect. 16), and the role of reconnection in particle acceleration (Sect. 17) are briefly mentioned.",

      "abstract": "Observation of auroras at low latitudes is an extremely rare event typically associated with major magnetic storms due to intense Earth-directed Coronal Mass Ejections. Since these energetic events represent one of the most important components of space weather, their study is of paramount importance to understand the Sun-Earth connection. Due to the rarity of these events, being able to access all available information for the few cases studied is equally important. Especially if we refer to historical periods in which current accurate observations from ground-based instruments or space were not available. Certainly, among these events, we must include the great aurora of February 4, 1872. An event whose effects have been observed in different regions of the Earth. What we could consider today a global event, especially for its effects on the communication systems of the time, such as the transatlantic cable that allowed a connection between the United States and Europe since 1866. In this paper, we describe the main results of the observations and studies carried out by Angelo Secchi at the Observatory of the Roman College and described in his Memoria sull'Aurora Elettrica del 4 Febbraio 1872 for the Notes of the Pontifical Academy of new Lincei. This note is extremely modern both in its multi-instrumental approach to the study of these phenomena and in its association between solar-terrestrial connection and technological infrastructures on the Earth. The Secchi's note definitely represents the first example of analysis and study of an event on a global scale, such as the Atlantic cable, affecting the Earth. What we nowadays call an extreme space weather event.",

      "abstract": "The World Magnetic Model (WMM) is a geomagnetic main field model that is widely used for navigation by governments, industry and the general public. In recent years, the model has been derived using high accuracy magnetometer data from the Swarm mission. This study explores the possibility of developing future WMMs in the post-Swarm era using data from the Iridium satellite constellation. Iridium magnetometers are primarily used for attitude control, so they are not designed to produce the same level of accuracy as magnetic data from scientific missions. Iridium magnetometer errors range from 30 nT quantization to hundreds of nT errors due to spacecraft contamination and calibration uncertainty, whereas Swarm measurements are accurate to about 1 nT. The calibration uncertainty in the Iridium measurements is identified as a major error source, and a method is developed to calibrate the spacecraft measurements using data from a subset of the INTERMAGNET observatory network producing quasi-definitive data on a regular basis. After calibration, the Iridium data produced main field models with approximately 20 nT average error and 40 nT maximum error as compared to the CHAOS-7.2 model. For many scientific and precision navigation applications, highly accurate Swarm-like measurements are still necessary, however, the Iridium-based models were shown to meet the WMM error tolerances, indicating that Iridium is a viable data source for future WMMs.",

      "abstract": "The rate of magnetic reconnection is of the utmost importance in a variety of processes because it controls, for example, the rate energy is released in solar flares, the speed of the Dungey convection cycle in Earth's magnetosphere, and the energy release rate in harmful geomagnetic substorms. It is known from numerical simulations and satellite observations that the rate is approximately 0.1 in normalized units, but despite years of effort, a full theoretical prediction has not been obtained. Here, we present a first-principles theory for the reconnection rate in non-relativistic electron-ion collisionless plasmas, and show that the same prediction explains why Sweet-Parker reconnection is considerably slower. The key consideration of this analysis is the pressure at the reconnection site (i.e., the x-line). We show that the Hall electromagnetic fields in antiparallel reconnection cause an energy void, equivalently a pressure depletion, at the x-line, so the reconnection exhaust opens out, enabling the fast rate of 0.1. If the energy can reach the x-line to replenish the pressure, the exhaust does not open out. In addition to heliospheric applications, these results are expected to impact reconnection studies in planetary magnetospheres, magnetically confined fusion devices, and astrophysical plasmas.",

      "abstract": "Multi-mode waveguides are ubiquitously used in integrated photonics. Although interaction among different spatial waveguide eigenmodes can induce novel nonlinear phenomena, spatial mode interaction is typically undesired. Adiabatic bends, such as Euler bends, have been favoured to suppress spatial mode interaction. Here, we adapt and optimize Euler bends to build compact racetrack microresonators based on ultralow-loss, multi-mode, silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits. The racetrack microresonators feature a footprint of only 0.21 mm<SUP>2</SUP> for 19.8 GHz free spectral range, suitable for tight photonic integration. We quantitatively investigate the suppression of spatial mode interaction in the racetrack microresonators with Euler bends. We show that the low optical loss rate (15.5 MHz) is preserved, on par with the mode interaction strength (25 MHz). This results in an unperturbed microresonator dispersion profile. We further generate a single dissipative Kerr soliton of 19.8 GHz repetition rate without complex laser tuning schemes or auxiliary lasers. The optimized Euler bends and racetrack microresonators can be building blocks for integrated nonlinear photonic systems, as well as linear circuits for programmable processors or photonic quantum computing.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a PYTHON package that provides simple and unified access to a collection of datasets from fundamental physics research\u2014including particle physics, astroparticle physics, and hadron- and nuclear physics\u2014for supervised machine learning studies. The datasets contain hadronic top quarks, cosmic-ray-induced air showers, phase transitions in hadronic matter, and generator-level histories. While public datasets from multiple fundamental physics disciplines already exist, the common interface and provided reference models simplify future work on cross-disciplinary machine learning and transfer learning in fundamental physics. We discuss the design and structure and line out how additional datasets can be submitted for inclusion. As showcase application, we present a simple yet flexible graph-based neural network architecture that can easily be applied to a wide range of supervised learning tasks. We show that our approach reaches performance close to dedicated methods on all datasets. To simplify adaptation for various problems, we provide easy-to-follow instructions on how graph-based representations of data structures, relevant for fundamental physics, can be constructed and provide code implementations for several of them. Implementations are also provided for our proposed method and all reference algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Since the initial isolation of few-layer graphene, a plethora of two-dimensional atomic crystals has become available, covering almost all known materials types including metals, semiconductors, superconductors, ferro- and antiferromagnets. These advances have augmented the already existing variety of two-dimensional materials that are routinely realized by quantum confinement in bulk-semiconductor heterostructures. This review focuses on the type of material for which two-dimensional realizations are still being actively sought: magnetoelectrics. We present an overview of current theoretical expectation and experimental progress towards fabricating low-dimensional versions of such materials that can be magnetized by electric charges and polarized electrically by an applied magnetic field - unusual electromagnetic properties that could be the basis for various useful applications. The interplay between spatial confinement and magnetoelectricity is illustrated using the paradigmatic example of magnetic-monopole fields generated by electric charges in or near magnetoelectric media. For the purpose of this discussion, the image-charge method familiar from electrostatics is extended to solve the boundary-value problem for a magnetoelectric medium in the finite-width slab geometry using image dyons, i.e., point objects having both electric and magnetic charges. We discuss salient features of the magnetoelectrically induced fields arising in the thin-width limit.",

      "abstract": "Lattice calculations of the proton spin components is reviewed. The lattice results of the quark spin from the axial-vector current matrix element at \u223c 0.3\u22120.4 is smaller than those from the constituent quark models. This is largely due to the fact that the vacuum polarization contribution from the disconnected insertion is negative. Its connection with the anomalous Ward identity is clarified and verified numerically. This resolves the contentious issue in the \"proton spin crisis.\" The glue spin and angular momentum are found to be large and there is notable contribution from the quark orbital angular momentum. Renormalization, mixing, and normalization of the quark and glue angular momenta are discussed. With sufficient precision, they can be compared with more precise experimental measurements when the electron-ion collider facility is available.",

      "abstract": "Since the discovery of the first fast radio burst (FRB) in 2007, and their confirmation as an abundant extragalactic population in 2013, the study of these sources has expanded at an incredible rate. In our 2019 review on the subject, we presented a growing, but still mysterious, population of FRBs\u201460 unique sources, 2 repeating FRBs, and only 1 identified host galaxy. However, in only a few short years, new observations and discoveries have given us a wealth of information about these sources. The total FRB population now stands at over 600 published sources, 24 repeaters, and 19 host galaxies. Higher time resolution data, sustained monitoring, and precision localisations have given us insight into repeaters, host galaxies, burst morphology, source activity, progenitor models, and the use of FRBs as cosmological probes. The recent detection of a bright FRB-like burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935 + 2154 provides an important link between FRBs and magnetars. There also continue to be surprising discoveries, like periodic modulation of activity from repeaters and the localisation of one FRB source to a relatively nearby globular cluster associated with the M81 galaxy. In this review, we summarise the exciting observational results from the past few years. We also highlight their impact on our understanding of the FRB population and proposed progenitor models. We build on the introduction to FRBs in our earlier review, update our readers on recent results, and discuss interesting avenues for exploration as the field enters a new regime where hundreds to thousands of new FRBs will be discovered and reported each year.",

      "abstract": "The ionosphere is the ionized part of the Earth's atmosphere, ranging from about 60 km up to several Earth radii, whereas the upper part above about 1000 km height up to the plasmapause is usually called the plasmasphere. We present a new three-dimensional electron density model to support space weather services and mitigate propagation errors for trans-ionospheric signals. The model is developed by superposing the Neustrelitz Plasmasphere Model (NPSM) to an ionosphere model composed of separate F and E-layer distributions. It uses the Neustrelitz TEC model (NTCM), Neustrelitz Peak Density Model (NPDM), and the Neustrelitz Peak Height Model (NPHM) for the total electron content (TEC), peak ionization, and peak height information. These models describe the spatial and temporal variability of the key parameters as a function of local time, geographic/geomagnetic location, solar irradiation, and activity. The model is developed to calculate the electron concentration at any given location and time in the ionosphere for trans-ionospheric applications and named the Neustrelitz Electron Density Model (NEDM2020). A comprehensive validation study is conducted against electron density in-situ data from DMSP and Swarm, Van Allen Probes and ICON missions, and topside TEC data from COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 mission, bottom side TEC data from TOPEX/Poseidon mission, and ground-based TEC data from International GNSS Service (IGS) covering both high and low solar activity conditions. Additionally, the model performance is compared with the 3D electron density model NeQuick2. Our investigation shows that the NEDM2020 performs better than the NeQuick2 compared with the in-situ data from Van Allen Probes and ICON satellites and TEC data from COSMIC and TOPEX/Poseidon missions. When compared with DMSP and IGS TEC data, both NEDM2020 and NeQuick2 perform very similarly.",

      "abstract": "Oblique, low-velocity impacts onto non-terrestrial terrain are regular occurrences during space exploration missions. These are not only a necessary component of landing and sampling maneuvers, but can also be used as impact experiments to reveal characteristics of the interacting surfaces. We conduct two-dimensional discrete simulations to model such impacts into a bed of triangular grains. Finite element method provides the basis for simulation, enabling the angular grain geometry. Our findings re-create the three classes of impact behavior previously noted from experiments: full-stop, rollout, and ricochet (Wright et al., 2020). An application of Set Voronoi tessellation assesses packing fraction at a high resolution, revealing how grains shift relative to each other during an impact event. We also assess how packing fraction at the point of impact influences different impact behavior types. Calculation of Von Mises strain distributions then reveal how grains shift relative to the overall system, leading to the notion of the 'skin zone'. Intuition would suggest that the region of perturbed grains would grow deeper with higher velocity impacts, results instead show that increasing velocity may evoke a change in the grains' dissipative response that dispatches energy predominantly laterally from the impact site instead of deeper into the bed. Finally, we consider how sub-surface response could link with impactor dynamics to deepen our understanding of oblique, low-velocity impact events, one day helping to improve mission outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Plasma and magnetic field observations by BepiColombo during its 2nd Venus flyby in August 10, 2021 have been examined and compared with the newly developed global hybrid simulation LatHyS for the Venusian environment. The LatHyS-Venus simulation was first validated by a comparison with Venus Express observations obtained during average solar wind conditions, before it was applied to the BepiColombo flyby using as inputs solar wind parameters measured upstream of Venus by Solar Orbiter. The simulation confirms that BepiColombo passed through the stagnation region of Venus, which supports the results obtained by data analysis. In addition, we have sampled the plasma parameters along the BepiColombo trajectory and constructed the energy spectrum for two species, i.e., protons of both solar wind and planetary origins, and planetary oxygen ions, and discussed the possible effects due to the limited field of views of the plasma instruments onboard BepiColombo. The most intense observational features are properly captured in the LatHyS-Venus simulation, which show that the model is a powerful tool for interpreting and understanding in-situ data obtained from the instruments with a limited field of views. The estimated ion escape for protons and oxygen ions at Venus during the BepiColombo flyby is of the order of \u223c10<SUP>24</SUP> ions/s, which is the same order of magnitude compared to the estimation from Venus Express observations at the solar minimum.",

The kinematic nature of the entire CMB dipole can be probed using the dipole of cosmic backgrounds from galaxies after the last scattering. The near-infrared (near-IR) cosmic infrared background (CIB) spectral energy distribution leads to an amplified dipole compared with the CMB. The CIB dipole is affected by galaxy clustering, decreasing with fainter, more distant galaxies, and by Solar System emissions and Galactic dust, which dominate the net CIB cosmological dipole in the optical/near-IR. We propose a technique that enables an accurate measurement of the kinematic near-IR CIB dipole. The CIB, effectively the integrated galaxy light (IGL), would be reconstructed from resolved galaxies in forthcoming space-borne wide surveys covering four bands, 0.9-2.5 \u03bcm. The galaxies will be subselected from the identified magnitude range where the dipole component from galaxy clustering is below the expected kinematic dipole. Using this technique, the dipole can be measured in each of the bands at the statistical signal-to-noise ratio S/N \u227350-100 with the forthcoming Euclid and Roman surveys, isolating the CMB dipole's kinematic nature.",

      "abstract": "Since its first identification on the surface of Ganymede in 1995, molecular oxygen (O<SUB>2</SUB>) ice has been at the center of a scientific debate as the surface temperature of the Jovian moon is on average well above the freezing point of O<SUB>2</SUB>. Laboratory evidence suggested that solid O<SUB>2</SUB> may either exist in a cold (&lt;50 K) subsurface layer of the icy surface of Ganymede, or it is in an atmospheric haze of the moon. Alternatively, O<SUB>2</SUB> is constantly replenished at the surface through ion irradiation of water-containing ices. A conclusive answer on the existence of solid O<SUB>2</SUB> on the surface of Ganymede is hampered by the lack of detailed, extensive observational datasets. We present new ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopic observations of Ganymede's surface obtained at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. These are combined with dedicated laboratory measurements of ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) photoabsorption spectra of O<SUB>2</SUB> ice, both pure and mixed with other species of potential interest for the Galilean satellites. Our study confirms that the two bands identified in the visible spectra of Ganymede's surface are due to the (1,0) and (0,0) transition bands of O<SUB>2</SUB> ice. Oxygen-rich ice mixtures including water (H<SUB>2</SUB>O) and carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) can reproduce observational reflectance data of the Ganymede's surface better than pure O<SUB>2</SUB> ice in the temperature range 20-35 K. Solid H<SUB>2</SUB>O and CO<SUB>2</SUB> also provide an environment where O<SUB>2</SUB> ice can be trapped at higher temperatures than its pure ice desorption under vacuum space conditions. Our experiments at different temperatures show also that the (1,0)/(0,0) ratio in case of the CO<SUB>2</SUB>:O<SUB>2</SUB> = 1:2 ice mixture at 35 K has the closest value to observations, while at 30 K the (1,0)/(0,0) ratio seems to be mixture independent with the exception of the N<SUB>2</SUB>:O<SUB>2</SUB> = 1:2 ice mixture. The present work will be part of a laboratory spectroscopic database in support of the ESA/JUICE mission to the Jovian system.",

      "abstract": "Radar and spacecraft observations show the permanently shadowed regions around Mercury's North Pole to contain water ice and complex organic material. One possible source of this material are impacts by interplanetary dust particles (IDPs), asteroids, and comets. <P />We have performed numerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of asteroids and comets over the few Myr and checked for their impacts with Mercury. We use the N-body integrator RMVS/Swifter to propagate the Sun and the eight planets from their current positions. We add comets and asteroids to the simulations as massless test particles, based on their current orbital distributions. Asteroid impactors are assigned a probability of being water-rich (C-class) based on the measured distribution of taxonomic types. For comets, we assume a constant water fraction. For IDPs, we use a dynamical meteoroid model to compute the dust flux on Mercury. Relative to previous work on asteroid and comet impacts (Moses et al., 1999), we leverage 20 years of progress in minor body surveys. <P />Immediate post-impact ejection of impactor material into outer space is taken into account as is the migration efficiency of water across Mercury's surface to the polar cold traps. <P />We find that asteroids deliver \u223c 1 \u00d7 10<SUP>3</SUP> kg/yr of water to Mercury, comets deliver \u223c 1 \u00d7 10<SUP>3</SUP> kg/yr and IDPs deliver \u223c 16 \u00d7 10<SUP>3</SUP> kg/yr within a factor of several. Over a timescale of \u223c 1 Gyr, this is enough to deliver the minimum amount of water required by the radar and MESSENGER observations. <P />While other sources of water on Mercury are not ruled out by our analysis, we show that they are not required to explain the currently available observational lower limits.",

      "abstract": "We propose a general method for finding a string-like meson spectrum which is based on a certain condition for the breaking of closed gluon string. A model is constructed that successfully realizes the proposed method. The model is based on the holographic Soft Wall model for QCD and the use of the Wilson confinement criterion. We applied our approach to the vector and scalar cases and obtained numerical predictions for the intercepts of corresponding Regge like radial meson spectra. A good agreement is obtained both with the existing experimental data and with some other known phenomenological approaches. Remarkably, our closed string breaking condition has two branches. We argue that they should correspond to states of opposite parity. The Wilson confinement criterion leads then to a natural mass splitting between parity partners. The constructed model represents thus the first example of bottom-up holographic model in which the effects of chiral symmetry breaking can emerge automatically, i.e., without additional assumptions taken outside of the holographic approach.",

      "abstract": "We investigate the effect of peculiar velocities of inhomogeneities and the spatial curvature of the universe on the shape of the gravitating potential. To this end, we consider scalar perturbations of the FLRW metric. The gravitational potential satisfies a Helmholtz-type equation which follows from the system of linearized Einstein equations. We obtain analytical solutions of this equation in the cases of open and closed universes, filled with cold dark matter in presence of the cosmological constant. We demonstrate that, first, peculiar velocities significantly affect the screening length of the gravitational interaction and, second, the form of the gravitational potential depends on the sign of the spatial curvature.",
